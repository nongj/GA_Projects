       "Hi I've never trained pull-ups before and now I want some lats so I'm buying a door-frame pull-up bar. There are two pull-up bars on eBay that I saw, one of them only has a few grips available but the other one has 12 grip options with angled grips and stuff. They're both about the same price so I'm wondering which one I should buy because obviously the 12grip one has more variety but I thought the amount of bars it has might affects the material's stability. The few grips one also has much more buyers and just more popular.

       "Hi,\\n\\nI've been practicing handstands for about a year - 4 days a week. The routine is quite simple - 8 minutes of practicing balance and form using walls and 2 minutes of practicing free-standing handstands. With all that said, I just can't seem to balance it constantly and can do it for 2-3 seconds on average (the strength part of a handstand isn't the problem). I think my form is decent and also, I know how to use my fingers for body repositioning. With heck of a lot videos watched on this subject and much more failed attempts of handstands, I've gotten really frustrated since my progress is non-existent.\\n\\nSo here I am asking you guys for any tip on how to balance a handstand that had helped you in your journey.

       "Hi everyone\\n\\nI'm over a year following RR. My progress is very good. I'm reached, the point where I have to decide what to do next. I'm mostly  on advanced exercises and RR routine make me very tired. It was excellent until now. I do currently 15kg dips ,20 kg flat possition rows ,85 kg squat ( I can do more ,but don't wanna progress here at the moment) , normal pull-ups ( straggling here to get more volume),65 kg Romanian deadlift ,85 kg deadlift, nearly full pseudoplanche pushups.  I do either find new program or do some adjustments to RR routine. I have been searching for programs. The most I like is Fitnessfaq ,but then I found information about gymnastics method from Adam Godrosi. I would like ask if someone doing this program or have done in past. I will appreciate any advice how to adjust RR to make further progress and not dying after workout. Maybe longer brakes between sets? I don't know. Of course I will appreciate advice on any other good program there with good references. My main goal is have very strong core to avoid back pain which I didn't have since starting RR. It's excellent program I would like to continue ,but I'm without power on last exercises.(weighted rows , following by pseudoplanche pushups are proper killers). I do own the OG2 book as well ,but I have absolutely no time to reading it properly and study. I do work 80 hours a week and I just wanna follow some programs three times a week max 1:30 min. I don't have more time. \\nThanks in advance for any advice ,help , support and suggestions.      1\n",
       "I'm curious if anyone has tried a greasing the groove style approach but for the whole body rather than just one exercise? \\n\\nEg something like Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, Dips. Depending on how it goes maybe add Kettlebell Swings in the future. \\n\\nI work from home, have all the equipment I need and have plenty of time on my hands. So I could easily do each exercise one per hour. I could even separate out the 2 upper and lower body exercises eg: Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, (wait 30 mins), Dips, Kettlebell Swings, (wait 30 mins), repeat.  \\n\\nI’d also do some light cardio after work just once a day, taking rest days from this as needed. I'd say I'm currently at an intermediate level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

Perhaps for \"push\", its repetition might be due to the word being frequently used as a form of encouragement. The words \"workout\", \"weight\" and \"routine\" form the common words pertaining to fitness which we expect, as they are related to certain fitness regimes.

    "Following on from above, certain words begin to make more sense when combined with adjacent words, the best examples being \"pull ups\" and \"push ups\", two unique exercises. As compared to their constituents, the invidiual words do not carry much meaning. While the majority of bigrams centre about discussions on workout routines, the bigram which caught my attention was \"feel like\", which was different from the other bigrams as it focusses on the emotional motiviations. Besides seeking for practical advice on fitness related matters, it appears that some users utilize the subreddit as a platform to air emotions, openly discuss feelings and seek validation on their arduous fitness journies. Generally, the bigrams for fitness posts are more meaningful. "

This is accompanied by words in the present continuous tense: \"pushing\", \"trying\", \"looking', \"training\". By inference, these key words elucidates the temporalities of fitness, which doubtless does not manifest in a single instance, but rather, is an accumulation of grit, effort and sacrifice expanded *over time* with a pre-defined end goal in mind.

    "The top phrase \"amp x200b\" may be ignored as it is simply a character code used for zero-width space in reddit threads, with no bearing on the nutrition data collected. The other bigrams are largely aligned with the topic on healthy eating, as alluded to by the mention of \"salt pepper\", \"olive oil\" and \"weight loss\". A phrase which appeared out of place is \"peanut butter\", the fourth most repeated word, since it is not exactly associated with a healthy diet.

    "\n",
    "As stated under the Model Framework section in Part 1, four model types (Logistic Regression, KKNeighborsClassifier, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest) will be considered for the final binary classification model. The intention is to ensure the production modelling process is comprehensive by evaluating model types with varying mechanisms in ascertaining the optimal. For all models, the TfidfVectorizer will be applied to transform the words/texts into meaningful representations of numbers for computational processing and analysis. The TfidVectorizer is known to be more accurate than CountVectorizer albeit more computationally demanding. For all models, we keep the TfidVectorizer arguments (i.e. max features, stop words, ngram range) constant to maintain consistency between model comparisons:  \n",
    "- Max features [500, 1000, 2500, 5000]: Limit the top tokens ordered by term frequency for comparison  \n",
    "- Stop word [None, English]: Explore model without stop words vs model adopting an English-based word list although logically, the latter will produce better results as it removes common words which does not value-add in classification  \n",
    "- Ngram range [(1, 1), (1, 2)]: Limit tokens to only unigrams and bigrams  \n",
    "    \n",
    "After performing train-test split, the modelling process involves the following steps:\n",
    "1) Create pipeline with TfidVectorizer and a specific model type  \n",
    "2) Incorporate parameters for model type into pipeline  \n",
    "3) Set up gridsearch to optimize classifier by iterating through hyperparameters to identify the \"best\"  \n",
    "4) Fit optimized classifer into the training set to train the model  \n",
    "5) View highest performing estimators and parameters put through the pipelines  \n",
    "6) Calculate score metrices for test dataset based on trained model  \n",

    "For step (6), we define a custom function for scoring metrices:  \n"

    "Comparing the scoring metrices, the three probabilistic models (Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest) had similar performances with accuracy, F1 and ROC AUC scores at 90% or above, which would meet the 90% benchmark set under model framework. In contrast, the KNeighborsClassifier model paled in comparison significantly, with scores in the range of 50% to 70%. This shows that building the binary classification model using distance logic for prediction is not advisable, likely due to a weak spatial relationship between observations. The large difference between the train accuracy score (80%) and test accuracy score (~50%) translates to the KNeighborsClassifier model being severely overfitted. \n",

    "Of the three remaining models, we will drop the Random Forest model as it performs relatively poorer across the spectrum of scores, albeit only marginally. Between the Logistic Regression model and the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, **we will select the Logistic Regression model as the final production model since it returns the highest scores for accuracy and F1 score, and the ROC AUC score is only slightly lower (<1% difference)**. Further, the difference between the test accuary and train accuracy scores for the latter (~2%) is noticeably higher than that of the latter (<1%), which signals to the Multinomial Naive Bayes model sufferring from a greater degree of overfitting. In sum, the production model has the following parameters: \n",
    "- *Model type: Logistic Regression*\n",
    "- Max number of features: 2,500\n",
    "- Stop words used: English\n",
    "- Best NGram: Unigram\n",
    "- LogReg Penalty: Ridge\n",
    "- LogReg Penalty Strength: Minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the test accuracy score for the production model, the model will be able to classify a given post correctly ~92% of the time. The high F1-score of ~92% illustrates an optimal equilibrium achieved in the precision-recall tradeoff; the model not only achieves a high percentage in determining the number of true positives over the total positives in the dataset, but with high confidence as well. Lastly, the high ROC AUC score of ~97% indicates that the model effectively minimizes false positives and false negatives, and has strong ability to distinguish between both binary classes (i.e. bodyweightfitness and EatCheapAndHealthy subreddits). \n"

    "The ROC curves corroborate the results above, in which the KNeighborsClassifier model is by far the worst performing model, while the other models have similar performances although the Logistic Regression model edges out slightly. The large area under the curve (measured by ROC AUC score) is a reflection of the model's high class separation capacity and the close-to-right-angled graph shows that for a given unit change in threshold, false values are effectively minimized accordingly.

I\\'ve always found calisthenics to be very interesting, but at the time I started working out I just enjoyed powerlifting a lot more. Fast forward to the covid climate I\\'m just not willing to risk going to the gym anymore. Also, I would rather have a better looking physique than be big and on the fatter side. I know each discipline isn\\'t exclusive to either, but I believe achieving each is easier depending on one\\'s discipline. \\n\\nA few questions:\\n\\n1. How do you guys think the transition from powerlifting to calisthenics will affect my muscle mass? I started cutting on the 1st of January and have only been doing calisthenics based workouts at home - these mainly consist of push ups, dips, and pull ups. \\n\\n2. I\\'m used to being in the gym for 2 to 3 hours at a time and doing a bodybuilding split after my initial workout of powerlifting. How long should my calisthenics workouts be? \\n\\n3. How do you guys plan your workouts? Do you use an app or some online guide? \\n\\n4. How does progressive overloading work in calisthenics? \\n\\n5.

For reference, I was at 5x20 + 1×20 offhand for one arm push ups prior to a surgery I had nearly a year ago. \\n\\nNow my max one arm push ups says weight vest is about 15—which seems much easier on my body now that I\\'m older anyway, something about those five extra reps was slowly killing me—but I just can\\'t seem to reincorporate weighted training in any meaningful way like I did in my 20s, when I could just throw on a 40lb vest and hammer out 10 quick one arm push ups. \\n\\nAre there any programs/books/YT channels out there involving actual weight vest programming for -advanced- calisthenics? So far all I\\'ve found, at best, is maybe Meckanimal and Matteo Spinazzola, but MS isn\\'t really putting out whole programs, and Meckanimal is just barbell + calisthenics. Most other people are less informed deviations of these two, or are just making meme videos for views.\\n\\nObviously, with damn near a year of sedentary behavior I\\'m also incorporating accessory movements such as weighted ab exercises except situps until I get a cinch strap to wrap the vest up like a plate and hold it to my chest (prevents loss of ROM), so if there\\'s not a big six plan available, accessory programming is also useful. \\n\\nYes, I\\'ve seen the recommended routine, no, it doesn\\'t answer these questions., Why is it so hard to do a muscle-up?

Well I really don’t like seeing my arms and legs so skinny it makes me insecure. I’ve always wanted to be a bigger bodied person and I believe bulking will help me reach that goal. I recently started going back to the gym on a strict bulking diet which I’ve been following for 2 weeks now. I’ve calculated that my maintenance calories are 3000 so I’ve been eating in a small surplus of 200. I believe this will make me gain roughly 1/2 lb each week. Below I’ll add my micros and calories I end everyday with. Any tips will help a lot. I’ve gained about 1 pound already in the course of these past 2 weeks. I plan to bulk for 5-6 months then follow a cut diet with a deficit of 500 calories.\\nShould I make any changes??\\n\\n\\nTotal calories at end of day: 3270-3300\\nFats: 128g\\nCarbs: 288g\\nProtein: 232g, Viable Routine to incorporate Weight/Calisthenics/Strength Skills?Hi Everyone,\\n\\nFirstly thanks for taking the time to look at this post.

I\\'ve always focused on lifting as heavy as possible when working out, so I\\'ve always had a pretty muscular physique. I\\'ve never had a problem with this previously, but lately I\\'ve been wanting to slim down my thighs and calves so they\\'re a little more proportional to my height. I\\'ve already slimmed down some, but I\\'m still not where I want to be yet. My current thigh and calf measurements are 25\" and 14\" respectively. I\\'ve still been doing 3-4 leg days a week, just lifting lighter weights and limiting myself to 3 reps each. Now, I\\'m looking to cut out weights entirely for my lower body and focus on bodyweight exercises. Will this be effective in helping me slim my legs while keeping a toned look, or will I just maintain my current size? Also, if anyone has any suggestions for good routines, I\\'m all ears.

I like to train to be generally all around athletic and mobile - so flexibility, strength, endurance, jack of all trades master of none, though my primary goal is fat loss (I\\'d like to hit \\\\~12% body fat and maintain that). I run twice a week for 30min, leg day twice a week for 30min, and upper body day twice a week for about an hour. I do a 20min yoga routine after each workout, so that\\'s 6 days a week I\\'m active. I can provide more detail upon request, but usually when I run I just vary my pace depending on how I feel, I use a lower body calisthenics routine largely derived from knees over toes guy, and my upper body routine is mostly rings based from coach Sommer\\'s book, about half of the workout on isometrics and the other half on dynamics.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m thinking about perhaps moving the running in concert with my leg day in order to grant me two additional rest days, but I\\'m not really sure if running after my lower body day is a good idea. I\\'d like to hear what other people have to say. I\\'m somewhat open to removing running altogether, which I\\'ve done in the past but I always eventually add it back in because I enjoy cardio and find its benefits useful.\\n\\nI\\'ll also add that my environment is generally stressful and that for sure impacts my recovery, but there isn\\'t much I can do about that at the moment (I\\'m writing my dissertation as a PhD student, for one)., Apps that can track RR progress, Apps that track RR Progression, The Natural Way to Supercharge and Maintain A Healthy Brain &amp; Hearing, Just out of curiosity how long does it take to learn a handstand, How long does it take to learn a handstand?, Want to reach body goals, need advice:), How long did it take you to do a handstand once started practicing?, Trying to get in shape?

I personally have a standing pull up bar and rings attached to it and its really good! \\n\\nNow im not saying you cant make some gaines without the equipment (Starting out) but it is recommended to have something or atleast one piece of equipment (get the rings in my opinion), So save up or do something if you really want to make the best progress possible because id be lying to you and so is everyone else that says \"you dont really need equipment to workout bro just do 100 push ups every day and some ab workouts\" I was told that crap when i first started my fitness journey and it was hella discouraging when I couldn\\'t even do 3 push up consecutively or never saw the results I wanted.\\n\\nNow sometimes parks have a pull up bar or even calisthenics equipment so you can also try that\\n\\nEquipment ive used/recommend:\\n\\n\\nYou can get the equipment i recommended earlier on amazon but if you decide to buy rings try to buy them with the longest strap possible and the biggest ring size, it just makes the rings more useful and comfortable in my opinion but its not a must if you dont want to.\\n\\nNow for the good stuff ;)\\n\\nYou might have seen me recommend these youtubers, Austin Dunham and Brendan Meyers on a few other posts but that\\'s because i used to watch them when I first started my calisthenics Journey and their programs really helped me out a lot especially Brandan Meyers body evo program which was the first program ive ever bought and saved up for when i was 15 and i dont regret it till this day. So what I\\'m going to do is share that program and Austin\\'s for you guys to enjoy and help kick start your journey and use it as a foundation for future programs that you may want to build later on your own, but if you choose to go another route or do your own research that\\'s fine but I honestly recommend these programs as a Foundation because now I make my own programs but every once in awhile I\\'ll reference back to these programs just for fun.\\n\\nLinks to the programs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA little Ring program from Daniel Vadnal for yall\\n\\n\\n\\nI recommend downloading the programs on your computer with an ad blocker and if you want you can even scan it with an anti-virus if you\\'re a little skeptical but youll be fine downloading it normally.\\n\\nTHIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.\\nWhen choosing a program or buying one on your own please for the love of God stick to it follow it to the T (unless you have to substitute an exercise because you can\\'t physically do it or don\\'t have the equipment)  and don\\'t deviate from it you\\'d be surprised how many people will buy or use these programs and not stick to them and complain about not seeing results because they decided to only try it out for a week maybe.

I am a seventeen year old female high school student who has been overweight my entire life. I currently live in the normal suburban town area in the United States with my family including my mother, father, respected grandmothers, and brother. Becoming healthier has always been a want in my life. I want to attend the gym. I want to diet. I want to do what is best for my body. But in the current circumstances I’m in, everything just seems so unpromising and difficult to follow through with. I really don’t know what to do. \\n\\nLiving with my family means adjusting to the diet plan of the house. My whole family is overweight, and do not seem to desire change in their lifestyles. The pantry is full of cookies and chips galore, healthy alternatives such as fruits and vegetables can rarely be seen, and the common dinner meal is usually a greasy, high calorie, take out dish, as everyone is too lazy to cook a decent home cooked meal. Although I want to provide the things to better my diet myself, the nearest grocery market is about an hour walk both ways, making it impossible for me to carry everything I buy back home. It doesn’t help that a huge snow storm came by making the roads and pavement walks icy. I don’t have a car or any other form of transportation to get me anywhere either. I would also like to attend a gym so I can get myself engaged in a motivational environment with people that obtain the same goal as me, to become healthier. However, the closest gym to my house is about a two hour walk one way. Especially with it being junior year, trying to balance school on top of that would be difficult and I would end up walking home alone in the evenings, which is quite scary to me. \\n\\nI try to do at home workouts, but I constantly face judgement from my family members. They laugh and make fun of me for dieting, and often approach me with a snarky tone for trying. I have lost the confidence to try anything in front of family, and just pray to get accepted into my dream university in an urban area where everything I wish to utilize can be easily accessible/obtainable for me. \\n\\nI really wish to change. \\nI want to treat my body for the better.   \\n\\nWhat should I do?, Fixing my hunchback in the gym?F (19), I have had double scoliosis since i was a teen and i have a hunchback, and it makes me really insecure. I was soppoused to do exercises for it when i was younger but i didnt take it seriously. My biggest problem is when i bend over or stretch my back gets so round, im so embarassed so i mostly never stretch in the gym. It makes me feel so unfeminine, unattractive, insecure and i feel like it makes my glute gains less visible (since my back is more round than my butt lol). I train my back twice a week, but I feel like its not that effective. I feel like its never going to get better and no matter how much i exercise im always going to be insecure. Tips, experiences?, Doing pullups with ab straps  \\n\\nCurrently with a stupid case of tendinitis, I see myself forcefully forbidden to do any pulling exercises, having a sharp pain if I do so.\\n\\nI have been trying to fix it and it seems it will take long. And so I don\\'t want advice on how to fix it per say. But I was wondering if anyone has used ab straps to do pull ups and how convenient will it be for my case (I want to do pull ups). Also if adding weight seems possible or not and overall you guys opinions.\\n\\n[ab straps like these](\\n\\nI can do reverse pushups (not sure about the name) where I am laying on my back and push back with my elbows and feel no pain., Best drink for weight loss, Need to improve my push-up capacity, any tips?Hey all, so I\\'ve been doing the RR and variations of it for a few months now, with reasonable success. However, I\\'m still pretty behind on my push-up capacity.\\n\\nFor example, I\\'m at nearly-horizontal rows for inverted rows and can easily do much more than my initial limit, and I\\'ve definitely progressed on exercises like deadbugs and ring ab rollouts/planks. But for push-ups, I\\'m still at incline push-ups, I\\'ve barely even managed to lower the incline, and I can still only barely manage the amount that I started at... \\n\\nWhat can I do to improve/increase my push-up capacity? Are there any exercises, stretches, etc. that I can do at home? (Right now I have access to a gym -- and I try to do a bench-press, squats, barbell rows, and deadlifts there at least 2-3 times a week -- but gyms are closing and I\\'m not sure how safe it\\'ll be to go for the next month, so I\\'m preparing to do as much of the RR as I can at home.)\\n\\nThanks!, Lower back questions/adviceHi!\\n\\nI’m quite the rookie at calistenics as I’ve only been working for about 6 months. I would still consider myself close to average since I can manage 10+ pullups and 15+ dips(not trying to brag just so you know my approx. current strength).\\n\\nSo my question is regarding exercises that target the lower back. In the program I’m following there are Skin The Cat exercises. I can’t really do them without bending my arms, but other than that I had no problem with them. But a month or so into doing them I started to get severe back pain. Taking deep breaths would physically hurt for example. So I simply stopped doing them altogether.\\n\\nI’m not sure if this is because the exercise is really difficult and shouldnt be done until proper strength has been achieved. Or perhaps im doing it wrong? \\n\\nSo I’m just looking for some advice as to how to move forward. Are there any other good exercises for the lower back that I could swap it out for? \\n\\nThanks in advance!, Training help, Rate my program and advise modifications pleaseHi,\\n\\n34M, 5’7” (170cm), and \\\\~152lb (69kg). \\xa0I’ve been working out on and off for 16 years without any real guidance. \\xa0Currently, I only have access to a pullup bar, so I am doing bodyweight exercises for now. \\xa0I have three goals--the immediate ones are to lose weight to get a visible six pack and to increase the number of weighted pullups/chinups I can do, and my longer term goal is to gain as much muscle as I can (hypertrophy). \\xa0The FAQ “Is My Workout Good?” section indicates that a good routine “Doesn\\'t include high rep situps or crunches,” so should I break up my 3-100 rep sets of crunches into more sets of fewer reps? \\xa0I use a calorie tracker. \\xa0I rest every other day. \\xa0I’m thinking about adding the Front Lever in one of the days, and, soon, I’m going to do 2 sets each of weighted pullups and chinups, decreasing the regular pullups and chinups to 3 sets each. \\xa0If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve my program, I would be most appreciative. \\n\\n**Day 1: Pull Day**\\n\\n10 weighted pullups \\\\~16lb (7kg) weight\\n\\n10 weighted chinups \\xa0\\\\~16lb (7kg) weight\\n\\n40 Pullups (4 sets x 10\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n40 Chinups (4 sets x 10\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n4x40 Russian Twists\\n\\n3x105 second planches\\n\\n**Day 2: Push Day**\\n\\n120 Feet-Elevated pushups (3 sets x\\xa040\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n20 Pike Pushups (2 sets x 10\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n120 pushups (4 sets x\\xa030\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n45 leg raises (3 sets x 15 reps per set)\\n\\n150 triceps bench dips (4 sets x\\xa050\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n3x\\xa0105 second planches\\n\\n**Day 3: Pushup Day**\\n\\n60 \\xa0Shoulder Tap pushups (2 sets x\\xa030\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n90 In and Out pushups (3 sets x\\xa030\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n90 Arrow Pushups (3 sets x\\xa030\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n90 Pushups (3 sets x\\xa030\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n3x 75 second Superman Holds\\n\\n45 leg raises (3 sets x\\xa015 reps per set)\\n\\n**Day 4: Lower Day**\\n\\n150 squats (3 sets x\\xa050\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n270 calf raises (3 sets x\\xa090\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n150 lunges (6 sets x\\xa025 reps per set, 3 sets on each side)\\n\\n300 crunches (3 sets x\\xa0100\\xa0reps per set)\\n\\n270 split squats (6 sets x\\xa045 reps per set, 3 sets on each side)\\n\\n6x\\xa075 second side planches (3 on each side)\\n\\nI rest for 2 minutes between each set.\\n\\nI also walk several miles a day if the weather is good.\\n\\nThanks!!, Imbalance while doing pull ups, Preparing for a callisthenics competition, suggestions for brand name, for bodyweight based training equipment brand, Help critique my routine please!I have been working out regularly since May*(had to find something productive to do during lockdown).* I worked out regularly 2-5 times a week since, and while i was dilligent at doing workouts, i was never very structured in my regiments.   \\n**I want to create some structured workout routines to follow,** and would appreciate some eyes on the plan i have drawn up.\\n\\n**ME:**  \\n**Age**`: 27 Male`  \\n**Weight**`: 60 kg(50kg back in may!)`  \\n**Height**`: 171 cm`  \\n**Build**`: Skinny fit?

Just checked and exercises like archer and typewriter pull ups seem to be harder than my shoulders-width weighted pull ups, mainly because the former use more lats compared to the later.\\n\\nIs this a good way of training? Taking into account muscle ups and front lever, which are even more advanced exercises, need more strength and technique.\\n\\nSo what do I do? Do I keep pushing for more strength or should I do a combination of sets?

When I started this process, it was fun; because at first it was casual and it wasn\\'t overly demanding in my personal time.

Healtly diet is also on the list.I may be a bit too much focusing on little things, but if it can prevent future injury, why not right? ) My question is which grip is better when doing the table row, parallel to your body or perpendicular?\\n\\nI don\\'t have any suitable table because the legs are in the middle. I also read here that the row is a \\'must do exercise\\'. I know the are many alternatives to replace the table,.For now I am doing it with dumbell pull and in the meantime I am designing a sort of specialized apparatus to do it properly. As of right now I am in the position to make it better (if any) and I also have the ability to make the grip orientation any direction I want.\\n\\nI have seen the barbell with parallel grip where you kinda stand in the middle when lifting it. If the regular barbell is good, why is there other type of grip for it?\\n\\nIf you guys can give me some pointer about the grip orientation it will be badass!\\n\\nThanks in advance.

What are the best Chin up progressions that I could replace the Mantle Chin up with? Archer Chin ups? Or should I do weighed Chin ups to build more strength? That would be limited though, because I train at the park and would have to carry weights in a backpack., How should I be training in Gym to maximize progression in calisthenics? I\\'m trying to progress in calisthenics but can\\'t afford the equipment I\\'d need to progress further but I am able to use my schools gym. So I\\'ve decided to train using weights. Should I be training like a bodybuilder: not close to failure and short rest, like a powerlifter: to failure and long rest or some other way? Also for how many repetitions should I go for and how long should my workouts be.

So, I started to work out recently and for the first stage before signing up for a gym, I bought a Dumbbell set of 30kg. \\n\\nI use this set to lift 2 weights of 14.9kg, and combining them with a connector to lift 30kg, as well as some Kettlebell and pushups. \\n\\nI increased my diet as far as possible, and try my best to do daily sessions and increase the count of times / sets each time. I also bought some whey drink with 25g protein to take after the practice. \\n\\nYet, I still feel like I do something wrong or not right per say. I would love advice and tips! \\n\\nAlso, is it realistic of me to expect some mass gain (mainly in my arms since I\\'m too thin there) and the period I should expect for the \"gains\" to be noticed? \\n\\nThanks!, Newbie here!Hey what’s up guys! \\n\\nI’m 28 years old, roughly 5ft 9/10 and hitting the scales at 119.7kg.

Thank you for the routine; it helps me get back in shape and feel better doing my everyday tasks.\\n\\nSo, I would like to get some suggestions on how to continue progressing. I am already using rings and weights, and I don\\'t mind buying more equipment to do different exercises. My main goal is to increase my core strength and start seeing a better definition of my abs.\\n\\nFor reference, I am doing the recommended routine three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays); on Tuesdays, I am doing 1h15min of HIIT, and on Thursdays, a 15k run.

Within a week lost 1.5kg (expected, mostly water), but I\\'m not sure I\\'ve noticed any perceptible difference in my power output. Granted, I switched to bouldering as my primary upper-body exercise in the last year, so I\\'m not really doing the same type of training as I was in early 2020.

My muscles just will not do the work and it\\'s impossible to lift myself up, but not from a sensation of pain or burning. My muscles just will not do it.\\n\\nBut when I do ab exercises, I have to stop just from the sheer burning sensation, but seems like if I\\'d be able to push through that pain I\\'d be able to continue for longer. I also feel like I can\\'t breathe well and have to take conscious deep breaths after I stop to relieve the pain in my abs before I can continue again.\\n\\nWhy is there such a big difference here in the experience of muscle fatigue, and is what I\\'m experiencing normal?

I first thought it might be my calves, but I don\\'t get why the fire is in the front of the ankles in that case.\\n\\nSome observations:\\n1. This started happening not just in pistol squats but in deep squats like asian squats too, neither of which had ever bothered me in my life until this started a few months ago.\\n2. Like mentioned in title, pistol squats I had been doing them for 8 years now casually, ankle flexibility had NEVER been an issue for me. \\n3. It\\'s not just soreness - my ankles as I start dropping will also lock up / freeze up, and the only way for me to go all the way down at that point is either to force it down (someone pushing me down or by holding a heavy weight), or lean back and drop on to my bum and then getting back on to the bottom of the pistol squat from the ground., How many knee pushups should i do a day?, A schedule for a beginner, Looking for a good pullup bar with multiple grips on Amazon, preferably wall-mounted.

I will start Week 2 tomorrow but I was thinking of adding in the Primer.\\n\\nMy concern is the following: Despite finishing the first week of C25k, I don’t think I have a good cardio base. After every run, I feel completely destroyed gasping for water (though slightly less so with every run I take).\\n\\nDespite the fact that I feel good after a couple of bodyweight exercises (like a massage you do on yourself), I worry that if I do the exercises on the days I’m not running, because of my couch potato-level cardio stamina and physique, I could be disrupting any potential gains by not resting.\\n\\nShould I:\\nA) Finish the C25k to Week 9 (the final week) first and then start on BWFP Primer.

(17M, 71kg, 186cm), I made an app to track individual muscle training frequency and training volumeI\\'ve used a multitude of workout tracking apps for my gymnastics ring training as well as tradition gym training, the first one I got worked okay for about 6 months, but then one day all my data was just gone. Next I used \"Strong\" and I still use it to this day to track every workout, but the only shortcoming is that I found myself getting so involved in the details of every rep, set and exercise that it was hard to focus on the bigger picture: training each muscle frequently, and with adequate training volume, specifically I wanted to make sure I trained each muscle at least twice per week with a certain amount of sets for each muscle group.\\n\\nAt first I just used a spreadsheet, but after a few weeks, I kept thinking that it just wasn\\'t very convenient or user friendly to have to open a spreadsheet, tap to open the keyboard, type something in, dismiss keyboard and repeat for each muscle group as I trained, I wanted something that wouldn\\'t distract me from my workout, because tracking my sets and reps in strong was already enough of a distraction.\\n\\nSo I made \"Built Training Log\" pretty much entirely to solve my own problem, however I now see that it could be of use to much more people.\\n\\nLink: \\n\\nIt\\'s basically a grid of 3 state buttons with muscles or exercises on the Y axis and the 7 days of the week as the X axis, with a sets column on the end to make sure you get enough training volume. First you plan out your week by tapping all the muscles / exercises you want to do on each day, then during your workout, all you have to do is tap to fill in the planned blocks after you\\'ve completed all sets for each muscle group / exercise.\\n\\nTracking my training has been a breeze ever since I finished this app so I hope others find it just as useful as I do.\\n\\nNot sure if this is against the rules or not, just wanted to share this because I think it could make a lot of peoples lives easier when it comes to tracking workouts., After COVID return strategy, How to excel at both bodyweight and gym training?Hey guys, anyone here successfully start doing bodyweight training (planches, handstands, etc.) while also seriously doing gym training (powerlifting or bodybuilding)?\\n\\nFor reference, I\\'ve been doing a mix of bodybuilding + powerlifting for 5+ years consistently. I\\'m decently advanced, with a 550 lbs deadlift, 300 bench, and 350 squat at 6\\'1 height and 177 lbs bodyweight. \\n\\nI still want to pursue some gym PRs, but want to start doing more bodyweight fitness training beyond pull-ups, dips, and weighted pushups. I think it would be fun to be more of a dynamic athlete vs strictly being good at moving weights around.\\n\\nAnyone here excel at both types of training simultaneously? If so, how do you balance both? Have you found them to be synergistic, or you have to accept a slower rate of progress on each. I would love to hear about your journey., Anyone do a mix of bodyweight and gym training? How do you excel at both?, Waistline, I want to try to do 100 push ups each day and I have a few questions. Mainly how they affect other workouts.Is it okay to also do regular workouts while doing push ups everyday? How will it affect my muscles being able to rest/ grow from workout to workout?\\n\\nI also don’t have access to a gym, so I’m using adjustable dumbells at home, along with bodyweight workouts, like pushups, dips. I’m going to add planks and other bodyweight only ab workouts, but I want to get into a routine first. \\n\\nMy intention of doing 100ish pushups everyday is to get into a routine of working out (I have adhd and struggle with consistency without routine.) Also, I’ve read that 100 pushups everyday is a great to start building up strength. Lastly, having a tangible goal of 100 pushups to do everyday will hopefully help with motivation and momentum with other workouts too. \\n\\nFurthermore, I know that the number of 100 pushups isn’t really important. I’ve been more focusing on doing as much as I can throughout the day. I’ve been doing mostly wall pushups, but trying to do 20 or so floor pushups for variation and training. Are wall pushups effective? Or should I try to build up to more floor pushups? I’m using knees for floor pushups right now. I also can’t do regular floor pushups because they hurt my wrists, so I’ve been using a bar and in the past I’ve used my fists. \\n\\nI would love to hear any tips/ advice, but my main question is how pushups everyday will interfere/ affect with needed muscle rest for growth with other workouts. \\n\\nThanks!, my arms are currently 9.5 inches, i want to get them to 14 inches.

So my doctor said that I have muscular dystrophy in my legs. I didn\\'t run in like 6 months because of pain in my legs. Now it\\'s better but it\\'s a wake-up call for me to start working out. I\\'m 20 years old male I have 173cm (5 feet 8) and my weight is 55kg (12.25 lbs) besides my legs I notice that my stomach is bigger than it used to be (it\\'s not noticeable for other people but I see it). My goal is to build some mussels mainly in my legs. A couple of years ago I tried working out in the gym for 2 weeks and it was a nightmare. I was always super tired, I have to eat so much food that I almost throw up plus a gym is too far away from the place that I live so I\\'m looking for some exercises that I can do in-home/park-gym.

I have been following a modified version of the RR for the last 1.5 years. Started sometime around August 2020. About 3-4 months ago, I was too weak to do pull ups. At this point, only a specific part of my tricep was muscle-y (don\\'t know how else to describe it). I also lost around 10 kilos in the process along with diet since I was overweight. I decided to maintain once I was around 71 kilos in May 2021. I measure my weight around twice a month.\\n\\nUntil 3-4 months ago I used to weigh around 70.5-71.5. Around this time, I discovered I can do pull ups with somewhat correct form so decided to add it to my routine. I am seeing drastic change in my arms. Almost my entire arm feels muscle-y and it\\'s visually bigger when I flex even on my rest days. I also weight aroung 73 kilos now. I am not sure if the weight gain is due to the me putting on muscle or me letting myself go a little around the months of Nov-Dec. By that I mean 5-6 hearty meals of junk food and the an additional snack made up of jaggery and peanuts (\\\\~extra 100-150 cals) almost thrice a week. Other than that my diet hasn\\'t changed. Too bad I haven\\'t measured my waist but I don\\'t think I have visibly gotten fatter., What are the main health benefits of calisthenics?, Diamond handstand pushups off the wall?Anyone here train these often or at all? I\\'ve been trying to build up to multiple 5 rep sets but it\\'s been tough. My goal is to push for 8 rep sets in the hopes of building more triceps mass off them. \\n\\nSo far my template for this has been starting with a wider hand base and moving about 3\" closer every time i hit my target rep/set range. I recently got 3 sets of 6 at 6\" apart. Moved to 3\" apart and got some 4s in. However the jump to touching was harder than expected so I\\'ll probably go back to 6\" apart to hit 8 reps/set and then back to 3\" again to try the same. \\n\\nDoes anyone have any other tips that have worked for them?, Diamond handstand pushups off the wall?, what are some basic skills a beginner should train, Bicep Tendon Recovery Advice?6.2 210lbs.

Just to give a little background: Starting out I could barely do leg raises and I couldn’t hold my lower back to the ground (initiating pelvic tilt). HOWEVER, I’ve improved a lot since then and I haven’t really felt the need to max out on leg raises on the ground as I do them hanging or on parallel bars. The problem is, I never really feel like my lower abs are working as hard as my upper, for example, after a 30s L-sit I will feel my upper abs “burning” and being much harder but feeling nearly nothing in my lower. I think this is probably related to genetics and that my body might store more fat in my lower abdomen since they also differ in definition.

I treat them as a main lift, much like a powerlifter would with SBD. \\n\\nI’ve used the conjugate method with chin ups, being 1 dynamic effort day and 1 max effort day and it seemed to have worked quite well in terms of increasing my totals. However, once I stopped running it, I have since lost strength on my chin ups. My bodyweight hasn’t fluctuated that much, only by a few pounds so that wasn’t the issue. I’ve tried mixing grips while using conjugate and that was pretty effective. \\n\\nBecause of this, I’m going to start conjugate again, but would like to know if there are any programs/routines that are effective.

I\\'m in some form of pain virtually every day. I try to workout regularly, but my mobility and flexibility are garbage, and there are a lot of things I avoid due to my injuries. My cardio is also nowhere near where I want due to these issues. It\\'s all super frustrating because I have been an athlete all my life, and now there are days that even walking my dogs takes some pushing through. \\n\\nI have been to physical therapy many times. I usually come away annoyed and bored. I do yoga sometimes. I like it, but I feel a lack of progress in some areas and some of the positions I simply cannot do. \\n\\nI am looking for something to help my mobility and flexibility. Something that I can incorporate with or around my strength routine. I have looked into gmb and knees over toes, but have been hesitant to pull the trigger. Looking for reviews on gmb is what led me to this sub. \\n\\nAny input or advice you guys can give on routines and programs that would help with my injuries, mobility, flexibly, and cardio would be great. Feedback on gmb, kot, or other programs would also be helpful., Benefits of “Elbow dips”?When I looked this up I saw something called Russian dips but they aren’t quite the variant I’ve been trying out, but I was doing them all day at work since they wasn’t anything to do and my chest and triceps feel sore and they haven’t felt sore since I started doing regular dips.\\n\\nThe variation I saw was like starting with elbows and turn into a regular dip, but what I’m doing is literally pushing myself up and down with my elbows. There’s less range of motion but I feel it may be hitting certain areas regular dips don’t.

Or should I just accept that I should only focus on the upper body?, HELP, What’s everyone’s thoughts on bracing inwards vs outwards?As a lot of us have no doubt seen there was a big drive on bracing inwards or exhaling completely whilst ab training to avoid ‘bread loaf abs’.\\n\\nPersonally I’ve found that if I spend a good amount of time fully expanding my belly or bracing outwards I actually have this great core activation, especially the obliques. \\n\\nI get why you need to exhale to get a great flexion and crunch of the rectus abdominis but could some of us need to train our abs in more of an extended position?\\n\\nExhale, flexion and crunch definitely trains the abs. \\n\\nBut could an inhale and brace train the abs in a more functional way, especially for those with poor posture. \\n\\nAnecdotally, dedicated ab workouts with more flexion based exercises and that cinched aesthetic after makes me feel a lot less stable than bracing and non cinched ab workouts. \\n\\nFeel like I subconsciously tighten my stomach in everyday life which restricts my breathing. \\n\\nSpending half hour focusing on expansion and tensing my abs definitely helps my posture.\\n\\nThose that subconsciously hold in their stomach are likely compensating for a weak overall core, IE weak glutes or hamstrings at the base of the core. Lower abs and stomach tightens inwards to compensate restricts the diaphragm from moving optimally therefore this laboured shallow and rapid chest breathing that many of us have.\\n\\nKeen to hear peoples thoughts?, Routine checkHi gang,\\n\\nI’m putting together a new custom routine.

(Running, Stretching and Bodyweight Training)Hey guys - I need some advice.   \\n\\n\\nI\\'m trying to work on building a functional and broad base of fitness. I\\'ve started running every day, but only about 2.5km for the first two weeks and will likely add 500m per fortnight until I reach around 6-7km a day. Along side this however, I\\'m finding that I finish my run in a park and I still have a bit of time and energy to fit in some resistance training. So;\\n\\nI want to know if there is some sort of basic full body workout routine that I could repeat, perhaps Monday-Friday mornings after my run, that would give me a basic level of strength. At the moment i\\'m doing: \\n\\n1. Super set of pushups, Australian pullups, and squats - 3x set to 80% capacity (perhaps 12-15 reps each).\\n2. Super set of chin ups, hanging oblique raises, single leg kickbacks and incline tricep pushup - 2x sets at 70% capacity (perhaps 3-6 chin ups, 5 oblique raises and 10 kickbacks each side).\\n3. 2-3 minutes of core - V sits, hollow body holds, crunches etc.\\n\\nI would really love some advice on things i could change or perhaps add to get a more rounded training program. Ideally I\\'d love to do the same or a similar workout every day along with a run. I travel a lot, and have a pretty varied schedule so I would love something I could just get up in the morning and smash out before my day starts.\\n\\nI appreciate any advice that anyone can throw my way, or even if anyone could point me in the right direction on where to read more about this. \\n\\nCheers!, BWF Daily Discussion and Beginner/RR Questions Thread for 2022-01-08 Welcome to the [r/bodyweightfitness]( daily discussion thread!\\n\\nFeel free to post beginner questions or just about anything that\\'s on your mind related to fitness!\\n\\n**Reminders:**\\n\\n* Read the [FAQ]( as your question may be answered there already.\\n* If you\\'re unsure how to start training, try the [BWF Primer Routine]( check out our [Recommended Routine]( or our more skills based routine: [Move](\\n* Even though the rules are relaxed here, asking for medical advice is still not allowed.\\n\\nJoin our live conversations on [Discord]( We\\'re also on [Facebook]( [Instagram]( and [Twitter](\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to look at previous Discussion threads, [click here.](, How to Re-Program Your Body to Lose Weight, Is it possible to work your pecs WITHOUT using your Serratus Anterior?, Chest 🔥🔥🔥🔥, Hurt my lower back deadlifting, anyone ever felt similar symptoms?I inured myself about five weeks ago.

With normal pullups, I always start from a dead hang, explode up, hold at the top for a second and then lower slowly back into a dead hang, then repeat. Ive had no issues doing them like this and will probably continue this way for unweighted pullups.\\n\\nNow for weighted pullups, I want to train these for max strength so sub 5 reps. I was unsure as to how to do the rep. Of course I will start in a dead hang, but when lowering is it safe to go into a dead hang with external load? Or would I be safer lowering until my arms are extended but while still maintaining scapular depression in an active hang. This is how I currently perform them. Of course I would like to go back into a dead hang and pull from there like I do with unweighted pullups, however my main concern is that over time will this damage my joints or the structures in my shoulders or elbows etc?\\n\\nAny help/advice regarding this is much appreciated!!, What calisthenic oriented workout (along with some weights) do you guys recommend or use?1) for those who have built decent muscles and size (not necessarily bodybuilder style muscles) what are some good calisthenics routines?

After trying out some curls following a set of chinups to failure, it became very clear to me that for the purpose of aesthetics, bar work alone wouldn\\'t be enough. \\n\\nI\\'m now doing something a little extra on the final or near-final rep of my narrow-grip chinups (I stopped doing pullups a long while back); I hold my position well above the bar.

(Every day)So for 6 sets, each are different variety of pushup (diamond, wide etc), then the seventh and 13th sets i start the cycle over again for another 6 variety. Each set consists of maxed out reps (till exhaustion). So my question is, is 18 sets too much? I do these everyday. But I\\'m wondering at what point will it become more muscle endurance than actually building muscle, which is what I\\'m actually after. The reason I do 18 sets is because on the 12th set my triceps are dead but my chest is not that worked.

I was content with my body 5’5”/108 pounds but wanted a better silhouette so focused more on abs/butt/shoulders. 2 years later I realized my shoulders have gotten broader - I definitely got stronger (went from 3 pushups to 20) - but I actually really dislike how I’ve lost my slender/petite form.

I train calisthenics for like year now, i was training with weights in the gym before. I dont train for skills, but for hypertrophy/strenght, so im progressing by adding weight. I follow PPL split and i personally like less exercises with higher volume (so 1 variation of vertical pull, 1 variation of horizontal etc.). Same for my push-day, i do 1x dips and 1x push-ups. The thing is, as i said i train mainly for hypertrophy, so with just dips and regular push-ups i will definitely grow good chest, but im just missing those incline benches from gym for upper chest ( i mean every muscle building program has incline pushing).\\n\\nWith calisthenics, for upper chest pushing, there are decline push-ups. Some people say its upper chest exercise like incline dumbell press for example, some say its harder variation of regular push-ups, some say they completely sucks because shoulders and triceps are heavily activated and you get almost simillar upper chest activation with regular push-ups.\\n\\nI tried them and i feel like they are more \"compound\" and just less isolating than incline presses, but they are still target that upper chest little bit more than regular push-ups i guess. \\n\\nSo my question is, do you think i can do dips+decline push-ups on PUSH day, could i do decline push-ups completely instead of regular ones, or the upper chest activation is not that big with decline a i will be better with sticking to regular push-ups ? What do you think ? Thanks, Question on r/bodyweightfitness appsHello!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m going back to bodyweight fitness and this sub after a few years.

In it, there is the recommended routine and two extra flexibility/care routines, and I had a few questions:\\n\\n* Is the in-app recommended routine equivalent to the one in the reddit section \\'Routines\\'? I see the \\'old\\' one in the app, with bodyline drills into the progressions like Handstand, instead of the \\'newer\\' pairs and the tripet approach.\\n* Where can I find the videos for the \\'Stretching routine\\' of the app? The videos won\\'t open when I click (it opens youtube but no video is selected)\\n\\nAnd overall, would you use another app or routine? What I like of the app is that it tracks progress so I\\'d like to pick an option that is maintained or has continuity, otherwise it doesn\\'t make much sense.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you!, Unsure if I should start bodyweight workouts now or stick to cardio, Which is the best Pike Push-up form?[ (me trying to replicate the different forms of Pike push-up that I\\'m talking about)  \\n\\n\\nHey there, this is kind of an exploratory/debate post where I would like to have your opinion and experience on the topic of pike push-up form. My main intent behind this post is to understand which approach is best for strength gains and transferability towards skills like HSPU and bent-arm presses. Every single tutorial on the pike push-up has a slightly different approach and gives different form cues, even when leaving aside the plain bad ones (wrt calisthenics transferability at least) like \"elbows flared out/head touching the ground between the hands/purely vertical plane of motion\" (as in [this picture]( Even among the main well-recognized calisthenics influencers, there are significant disparities on the topic of pike push-ups.\\n\\n# The different forms\\n\\nI think there are mainly 2 approaches, although there is a whole spectrum between these two \"extremes\". These approaches seem to agree on what the top-part of the ROM should be (elevating the shoulders as much as possible, tucking the head between the shoulders, as shown in picture A), but differ in the lower part of the ROM.\\n\\n\\\\- The first one (depicted in picture B) advocates for a diagonal movement, where the goal is to touch the ground with the nose very far forward in front the hands in order to increase the ROM. This is the form promoted for instance by Antranik in [this detailed post]( With this form, it is considered that some arching in the back is OK, since it would be very hard to maintain a perfect posterior pelvic tilt and hollow body in this position.\\n\\n\\\\- The second one (depicted in picture C) advocates for a movement that is closer to vertical, where the goal is to lower the head until the forehead or top of the head touches the ground and forms a \\\\~equilateral triangle with the hands. Examples of influencers promoting this technique are FitnessFAQs (for instance in [this video]( from 1:35 on), SaturnoMovement ([in this video]( Tom Merrick ([here from 3:27]( A particular emphasis is placed on maintaining a Posterior pelvic tilt, and preventing any kind of arching in the back. Another cue that is given in some of these videos is to purposefully shift as much of your weight as possible on your hands from the very beginning of the motion, only tipping as lightly as possible on your toes.\\n\\n\\\\- An example of an in-between approach would be that proposed by Yaad Mohammad in [this video]( from 6:40 on: he touches the ground with his nose, but not too far forward, and insists on keeping a hollow body (which I tried to replicate in picture D).\\n\\n# My experience\\n\\nI\\'ve experimented with these different forms in the past several months (on the grind for the frog-to-handstand), and my feeling so far has been the following: I found the second, more vertical form noticeably harder than the first one (with all other parameters equal: elevation of the feet, distance from feet to hands), and felt a stronger load on my shoulders, whereas I feel like the first form somewhat offloads the shoulders in favor of the upper pecs in the lower range of motion (probably due to its slight resemblance to pseudo-planche push-ups). I\\'ve noticed that trying to touch the ground with my nose instead of my forehead induces some arching in my back, which seems to make the movement a bit easier as well, despite the increased ROM. In my experience, the \"shift your weight on your hands\" cue makes the exercise significantly harder, and when your feet are close enough to your hands, they should almost be able to lift off the ground when at the bottom of the ROM.\\n\\nI\\'m still not anywhere close to getting a full HSPU or bent-arm press, so I didn\\'t want to draw conclusions based on my experience alone. Which is why I would like to hear your opinion!\\n\\n# What is your opinion?\\n\\n1. Which form has the best carry-over to skills like handstand push-ups and bent-arm presses?\\n2. From an anatomical/biomechanical perspective, what makes the second form harder than the first one?\\n\\nPS: I know that this post is kind-of nitpicking, and that just getting the reps in is more important than debating endlessly about form, but still I really like learning more about the theory and the anatomy/biomechanics around calisthenics!, Weight loss, Can\\'t feel my middle deltoid, Help, How can I incorporate bricks as weights in the RR?So, I don\\'t have any gym equipments like dumbbells, barbells, weights anything...

The bricks weigh about 2-3kgs each.\\n_____________________________\\nI dunno if anybody would be interested in reading so you can skip it but the thing is i have always been skinny (106lb/49kg at 5\\'6) and i hate it.

I feel like when I exercise i feel very relieved and it clears my mind. \\n\\nI know this part became a bit ranty so sorry for that.\\n________________________\\nThanks for reading!, What are the benefits of the keto diet plan, HOW THIS PROGRAM CHANGED MY LIFE, Splitting the RR into a 6/1 UL SplitHey guys, one thing I’ve noticed is that I have horrible consistency with working out only 3x a week plus I never liked how long the workouts take.

Even though I\\'m overweight, I\\'m having a good time and progressing decently well! \\n\\nThis is a total beginner question, but I haven\\'t had any luck in seeing it answered. \\n\\nI know that if you weigh more, calisthenics is tougher, especially the deeper you go, and your progress will be slower. While I\\'m totally fine with that - woudn\\'t me being a heavier weight be..helpful? Now I know that\\'s a dumb question but I\\'m not sure why that isn\\'t the case. Wouldn\\'t I get stronger if I start doing pullups at 185-190 lbs vs 150-155 lbs? I know that isn\\'t correct, but would love it if someone could help me out.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you!, My 58 years old mom wants to start exercising slowly, where to begin?Hey! My mom just turned 58, shes still pretty healthy and walks atleast 30-40 minutes 5 days a week (walks home from work every day). And sometimes longer walks on the weekends. She is not obese or severely overweight, just some extra lbs and some excess belly fat which obviously not great. And she has not lifted weights (ever) or had any form of resistance training in many many years.\\n\\nShe has gained some weight in the last few years and would like to lose some. I\\'ve calculated her macros and will help her plan her meals and learn to count calories somewhat as I am still living at home for another 6 months before going to Uni after the summer, I\\'ll make sure she gets some more protein aswell! Hopefully I can get her started abit while I\\'m still at home. She asked me for tips, or if we could start slowly every weekend with some bodyweight exercises together both for health and for bonding time.\\n\\nI am not quite sure where to start? Before doing any added weights I\\'ll tell her the importance that we go get a clear from a doctor first which I would recomend anyone at any age. I assume some cardio, and the regular push pull and leg/hinge exercise is beneficial at any age? Like pushups (starting easy against a table or wall). Maybe getting up from a chair in the start and transitioning into squats/lunges, and maybe some row movement? Other than that I was thinking some yoga or just light stretching. But I would really love some tips or guidance from anyone with more experience, I only started exercising regularly a couple years ago myself but have been doing pretty well myself, however I am in my 20\\'s and I assume it\\'s quite different?\\n\\nI have built like a mini gym at home during Covid, we have access to dumbells, a barbell, squatting rack, bench, resistance bands, pilates ball and yoga mats, and a pull up bar.\\n\\nIs there anything I should avoid? Or any signs that we should move onto something else, and some things to keep in mind, like soreness not going away after a few days?\\n\\nThank you in advance!, Reps or Sets?I\\'ve been doing casual calisthenics for a while now, almost a year, but i came to a point where i\\'m no longer able to progressively do more reps. With chin-ups for example, i do an all-in first set, then my second and third set have half of the first set in terms of reps and my fourth one is basically just hanging on the bar. And since 3 months ago or so i noticed that my progress has been really, really slow, almost unable to get + 1 rep in the first set even after that long. That lead me to think what might be wrong, and considering that my diet is not that bad and i really try my best in each workout, i thought it may be happening because i focus too much in the first set, so, would it be better if i even out my sets and do the same amount of reps in each one?, To cut or bulk: Sprinting, Is 20 mins of exercise okay?, What\\'s a reasonable time frame to learn the freestanding handstand if I can already kick up and hold it for 3-4 seconds before losing balance?, Started developing crepitus in the knee (no pain), Returning to training post COVID (Not seeking medical advice), fitness, Would you be able to attach gymnastic rings to a door the same way that you can with a trx?

I’ve been working pistol squats for about a month now and I’m noticing a pretty significant strength imbalance between my two legs on these. \\n\\nFor example, I can do 5-6 unassisted (or maybe very light assistance towards the end) on my left leg. On my right, I can do maybe one unassisted on the first set but pretty much all subsequent reps/sets, I need at least a partial assist to get back up from the bottom.\\n\\nI’m not sure if it’s a mobility/ankle strength issue maybe, although I am able to hit full range of motion on both legs even if I can’t get up from it unassisted on the right. I don’t think flexibility is a huge issue though—I’ve always been quite flexible.\\n\\nAny help/suggestions are much appreciated, thank you!, Is push-ups a good way to slim up my arms???, Goals for 2022This year I hope to keep training strength consistently. As a realistic goal I\\'m going to hold myself to at least two workouts a week. I lead a really active lifestyle and have a weird work schedule so keeping a good workout schedule is difficult.\\n\\nI\\'ve not been too interested in skills work until recently. I think it would be a good motivator to try to finally get some cool skills down that I\\'ve neglected. This year I want to achieve a consistent press handstand. My main obstacle here is going to hamstring flexibility. I\\'ve always struggled so much with my flexibility. If I don\\'t consistently stretch I literally cannot touch my toes or hold my legs straight out in front of me, for instance in an L-Sit pull up (which is an exercise I love but always do with knees bent). So mini-goal is hamstring flexibility and mega-goal is press handstand. I don\\'t quite have the shoulder strength but I love pushing and getting that part of the skill will be fun for me.\\n\\nNext skill goal is a full front lever. I can tuck front lever for around 45 seconds at this point so I think with consistent training here I can achieve a solid few seconds of full front lever by the end of the year.\\n\\nFinally I REALLY want to get a muscle up. I think I\\'m really close here. I can bang out deep ring dips and chest to bar pull ups with good form pretty well at this point. I\\'ve been trying to train the transition part of the muscle up but it\\'s really a crux move still. I think I need to get a stronger false grip so I\\'m going to focus on that. I may also be looking to purchase weights for my dips and pull-ups. Anyone have recommendations for products? Should I get a vest or a belt with plates?\\n\\nAnyway thanks for reading. What are your goals for 2022?, Hollow body neck engagementI\\'ve been gym training for 3 years. Although my muscles are developed I feel as though my core is lacking, which could be the cause of my shoulder and neck stiffness/tightness. Tried doing the hollow body hold multiple times and, especially when lifting off the ground I feel my neck, back and legs work way more than my core/abs. \\n\\nIf I try to lift my legs and upper body off the ground STRICTLY using my abs/core and nothing else, my legs slightly raise and my upper body doesn\\'t budge.\\n\\nApologies for the long build up, my question is - should my legs and upper body be completely relaxed during the hollow hold? \\nThanks in advance, Pull-up/dip station that can also be used for front and back levers?, Chinup ladders are a cheat code.Ill start this out by saying im an overthinker and my mind is usually the biggest obstacle to what i can lift. At the gym i was able to do 15 v bar chins, but everytime i had to lift at home all i had was a basic bar and i was doing like 12 rep sets that felt like complete trash. \\n\\nRight now i decided to try ladders, (1, 12, 123 etc) didnt do them exactly as written (very impatient person) but rather just counted my reps as 1, 12, 123 without letting go of the bar instead of counting normally. I just repped out 5 sets of 20 like it was nothing. And to think i was honestly considering doing rows. \\n\\nIf anyone else out there shuts down when they get to what their mind perceives as a hard set you have to try this shit, probably even better if you do it with rest in between., Different variations in the same day or in different days?What\\'s recommended for being proficient in the different variations of a given exercise? For example, there are pull ups, typewriter pull ups, archer pull ups, weighted pull ups and so on.\\n\\nObviously weighted pull ups are a better version of non weighted pull ups for strength. But what about Archer and Typewriter? How can incorporate them in my existing routine without making it longer or replacing other exercises?\\n\\nShould I do 2x weighted and 2x archer (or typewriter) or should I do 4 sets of weighted on monday and 4 sets of archer pull ups on wednesday?\\n\\nThe same applies to other exercises like weighted dips or russian dips. What is the best combination?, The best setup for doing weighted push-up at home!Video: \\n\\nTo do this, you need a pair of straps. You can use martial art belts. I bought mine for 5 bucks. If you don\\'t have a plate loader, you can just loop the strap through the weight plates.\\n\\nBenefits of this setup:\\n* Allows you to go down as deep as you want.\\n* The weight hangs directly below your upper back and chest.\\n* Doesn\\'t cause discomfort in your lower back.\\n* You can go extremely heavy without needing a spotter like with a bench press.\\n\\nI have done reps with 65 kg of plates hanging off me like this. It\\'s definitely the best way to go heavy on chest at home., Did you know Strawberry powder has super benefits when it comes to your health and exercise regime? 😱, Training when going through a hard timeMy family is going through a rough time at the moment between Covid and other health issues.

On top of that work is not going well, which all adds up to a lot to deal with.\\n\\nI have had to severely cut back what I do because I lack the energy and motivation to do more (staying at home because of Covid doesn\\'t help) so I wanted to ask those that have undergone or are in tough situations how you manage to schedule your training.

TIA, How Do I burn my fat, 60 kg to 52 kg over 35age?, How do I reduce weight 60 kg to 52 kg simple and best plan?, Pull up bar recommendations?, One arm pushup as a form of obliques trainingHello everyone, my stats are as follows (so that this post isn’t removed): M 177cm/5’9.5 and 77kg/170lbs. I’ve been lifting weights for several years (been following a structured routine for only the last 1.5 years). I can do bodyweight +150lbs dips so I have a good amount of pushing strength and one arm pushups are not a challenge for my triceps or pecs.\\n\\nThe discussion I want to start comes from the observation that whenever I do one-arm pushups, I feel intense doms in my obliques the next day. This is obviously because of the intense strain on the obliques to prevent the body from twisting and collapsing during the movement. I haven’t felt this much strain on my obliques for any other movement despite training obliques consistently through other exercises such as woodchoppers, windshield wipers, and side planks.\\n\\nMy question is: does anyone have experience with performing one-arm pushups as an exercise to mainly train and induce hypertrophy in obliques? Or is there a similar bodyweight exercise that stresses the obliques as much? Right now, the only one that comes to my mind (apart from ridiculous moves like one arm front lever or planches) is the human flag., Help!!

I was 160 cm(5\\'2 ft) and 80 kg(177 lbs) when i first started, just plain overweight. And now i\\'m 165 cm(5\\'4 ft) with 60 kg(135 lbs). Until like 3 months ago, i only cared about  calories in n out with extreme 1300-1200 calories a day. Of course that led me to lose so much muscle and leaving me with a skinny fat look that i have now. I decided to just cut the calories super low again and lose weight(yes even muscle) because i tried to maintain/build muscle mass while losing fat at the same time and i found it really hard and just didn\\'t work out for me. However, yesterday i checked my 1rm of chin-up cause i was just curios about it. Now i wasn\\'t able to do a single chin up until i became 66 kg(146 lbs) which was 4 months ago. But yesterday, i was able to do full chin up while wearing a backpack filled with 25 kg(55 lbs) of stuff. I was heavier than i ever was with that backpack!(60+25=85 kg) even heavier than before i started losing weight. But there could be just one lame answer to that. So as i mentioned before, i tried to lose weight and build muscle at the same time with a reasonable 1800 calories a day and also calisthenics strength training 4-5 times a week. i did that about a month but there was just no visible change. so does that mean that 1 month of proper workout increased my strength that much without any physical change ? But that wasn\\'t the only workout i threw in since the whole weight loss started. I been doing 100-200 pushups a day for 7-8 months till last september but it\\'s hard to be called a proper workout. Because i didn\\'t know anything about near failure, reps, sets so i\\'ve just been doing some pushups throughout the whole day so i doubt that did anything to my strength. So if you know the reason why i built strength while being on a crazy calorie deficit, please let me know., BWF Daily Discussion and Beginner/RR Questions Thread for 2022-01-05 Welcome to the [r/bodyweightfitness]( daily discussion thread!\\n\\nFeel free to post beginner questions or just about anything that\\'s on your mind related to fitness!\\n\\n**Reminders:**\\n\\n* Read the [FAQ]( as your question may be answered there already.\\n* If you\\'re unsure how to start training, try the [BWF Primer Routine]( check out our [Recommended Routine]( or our more skills based routine: [Move](\\n* Even though the rules are relaxed here, asking for medical advice is still not allowed.\\n\\nJoin our live conversations on [Discord]( We\\'re also on [Facebook]( [Instagram]( and [Twitter](\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to look at previous Discussion threads, [click here.](, What would you change and why?, Build more muscle: Add weights to RR or switch routine?Hi everyone.

Our body only then recognises this as \\'yep that\\'s enough food. We\\'re good.\\'\\n\\nI also learned that insulin stimulates both the synthesis and secretion of leptin. This has the following implication: we need a rise in blood sugar, so that insulin can get released -&gt; secrete a fair amount of leptin -&gt; feel full. On this idea, my lecturer said that \"fats making us fuller\" comes across as a misunderstanding for the most part. Whilst it could keep you full ***after*** you feel the initial \\'fullness\\', but to *actually feel full in the first place,* fats are actually counteractive. This is because fats slow the digestion rate of both proteins and carbs (ie. agents who are capable of spiking blood sugar) and delays insulin secretion, and therefore leptin secretion as well.\\n\\nAnd this led onto an important point for those following LCHF/keto approach; for those who don\\'t track their calories and only just \\'listen to their body\\', having such high intake of fat + very limited rise in blood sugar levels, they could actually PUT ON WEIGHT because they have harder time feeling full after they eat!\\n\\nThis was the main takeaway from the lecture though. Any ideas/counterarguments/supporting arguments?

The mentorship was supposed to be a personalized guide from experts.\\n\\nSo I had an appointment with one of their ?staff? Let\\'s call him James. (can\\'t remember his name. I think it wasn\\'t his real name anyway). We met in Zoom and we talked for 1 hour. First James wanted me to talk about my training experience and my current problems in calistenics. I explained my situation, the typical plateau in like everything and how my current routine looks like. After that, James gave me an overview of their \\'service\\'. Individual training routines, why my routine was trash and why I am stuck on this plateau. \\n\\nAt the end, he made an offer (verbally). If I\\'d pay 1.700 €, I would have gained access to all the things he pointed out earlyer for life time. But due to their full schedule they couldn\\'t offer individual support but access to \\'all the knowledge Dominik has\\' with videos. This would have costed me only 1.500 € BUT this offer was a one time chance. Also there was only one chance. If I delince this offer, they won\\'t come in contact with me in the future. I had to decide in this moment. He gave me a link via Zoom to the payment. 1.500 € with Paypal.\\n\\nAll this made me think because it seemed weird and here is why:\\n\\n\\\\-In my opinion the price is absurd. Think about it. Where I life, a normal gym membership with trainers and all the other stuff and staff costs 30€ per month. That\\'s a bit more than 4 years of membership if you summ it up to 1.5k\\n\\n\\\\-I had no valid information about getting my money back, If I won\\'t like it. He said for one month I had guarantee.

When I do 3 sets of regulars, reps decrease over the sets and I end up with only 2 or 3 in the last set. \\nIs that still better than sticking to negatives, or does that mean I\\'m just not ready for regular pull ups in my routine.\\nAnd adding to that, when would I change from negatives to regulars. \\nAnd is there a progression for negatives in itself, since they can be quite differently challenging depending on how long you take to go down.\\n\\nMany questions, thanks in advance., Why exercise builds muscles: titin mechanosensing controls skeletal muscle growth under loadInteresting paper proposing a biological mechanism for muscle growth in response to resistance training from the Cavendish Labs in Cambridge. Nothing earth shattering from the POV of current practice, but the proposed mechanism does a much better job of explaining things than \\'exercise damages the muscles which regrow bigger\\'. (Feel free to skip all the maths: the introduction &amp; conclusions give a reasonable overview...)\\n\\nLink: [, Hypertrophy Training, Have we finally seen the end of the ridiculous fad of guys wearing women\\'s stockings to the gym?, (FX) Technology in ExerciseTechnology has evolved the day to day life of individuals as it has completely changed the way of living and doing business. One of the modern trends and major resources in this is, of course, the use of mobile applications. Technology makes many things better and easier. Health and Fitness are no exception. Apps and smartphones have become a considerable part of today\\'s culture and overruling everyone\\'s life with their ease of use and significant features.\\n\\n    \"How do mobile health and fitness apps help the user?\"\\n\\nThe market is flooded with numerous health and fitness apps each offering different advantages. A person aspiring to become more fit can choose from among these options. Let us take a look at how mobile apps help us stay in shape.\\n\\n• Apps have made fitness routines more affordable and accessible:\\n\\nYou no longer need to go hunting for a yoga class or gym in your neighborhood or hire costly personal trainers to lose weight. Just look up a suitable app that meets your needs, install it on your Smartphone or Android and start pumping. Distance and money can no longer prevent people from exercising.\\n\\n• Set realistic fitness goals:\\n\\nThere are many of us who aspire to look like supermodels regardless of our lifestyles. We may be trapped in sedentary lifestyles and jobs which offer little or no opportunities for fitness. Setting up an unreachable goal at the beginning of our workout regime can be the catalyst for starting the fitness regime, but is hardly sustainable. Apps like Couch to 5K help to set up realistic goals within our desired time frame. They take us to the next level of exercise only after we achieve the previous target. This helps in sustaining our exercise regime which is the hardest challenge for beginners!\\n\\n• Apps help to monitor your workout routines: \\n\\nThere are mobile apps that will need you to put data like your calorie intake, your daily routine, your fitness regime, and your fitness goals. They will monitor your calorie intake and calories burnt throughout the day. They will offer encouraging comments throughout your workout regime and tell you how to perform a particular exercise. Myfitnesspal and Edmundo Sports Tracker are apps that store our personal workout history and motivate us to outdo our best performance. \\n\\nRunning apps like Runtastic help us to see our running progress. If you are bored of your running workout, you may use apps like Zombies run to change your regime and make it more interesting. This app turns your daily runs into epic missions. Each run you go on is like an episode of a zombie show and you’re the main character. All you need to do to get started is to start a mission and listen to the story as you run. What makes it more exciting is that you hear zombie sounds as you run and the only way to get away from them is to get moving. Often we feel dehydrated while running. There is an app to monitor your water intake as well! It’s called Waterlogged and it pushes you to take water at regular intervals during your run.\\n\\n• Offer new ideas for your workout regime: \\n\\nApps like Jefit and Body fitness are advanced apps that suggest new resistance training workouts for specific muscles in our body. The Yoga app and Tai Chi are more apps that give specific pictures, instructions, and videos to improve your workout and stretch-on-the-go.\\n\\n• Monitor our diet and suggest healthy methods of cooking:\\n\\nIt is well-accepted fact that for losing weight and improving our overall health, diet is as important a factor as our fitness regimes. If you are concerned about the food you are eating, there is no shortage of apps to advice you about healthy options of food to choose, the nearest dietary store or restaurant, healthy methods of cooking a particular foodstuff and calculate the number of calories you consumed and need to burn! MyNetDiary and CalorieCounter are two popular apps in this category.\\n\\n• Apps help us to stay connected with people having the same fitness goals:\\n\\nSome health apps like iMapMyRide, FitGang, and iMapMyFitness are linked to social networking sites like Facebook. They help us to connect with people having the same fitness goals and following the same fitness regimes. This helps to build an inspiring community of health lovers and even offer healthy competition among the members.\\n\\n\"So, what are you waiting for?

I take 2 scoops of Whey and try to prioritise proteines in my meals (chicken &amp; egg or sandwiches, chicken thigh for dinner, etc.); overall about 130 grams of proteine a day. I also started eating more healthily regarding my carbs (whole wheat pasta and whatnot).\\n\\nI made some good progress in the meantime, but I am not sure if what I am doing is the best way to go for me right now.

I run into this situation a lot. One site says crunches are a good workout, experts say they are garbage. Another says sit-ups are good, experts also say they are garbage. Surprisingly everybody seems to agree that planks are good although I\\'m sure in a few years they will be seen as garbage too. There is just so much conflicting information.\\n\\nSo, are there any good reliable sites with workouts that actually do something? Either recommend sites with workouts that are actually effective, sites to avoid, or workouts that work for you. I trust the various workout communities on Reddit more than I trust the 295983963959 workout sites and the Google \"experts\".

Rest for 10 min then repeat, 2 days a week.

A lot of people say they’re ripoffs. \\n\\nThanks in advance and happy new year!, Powerbuilding VS calesthenicsI have a lot off experience with powerbuilding it was my main workout source before Corona. When everything closed I turned to calesthenics. With this I had a lot more progression in how I look(probably also had to do with there being no parties). Now back to today the gym is back open. Now i\\'m twisted so much between the two that I asked myself if others blended them.\\n\\nFirst some personal pro\\'s and cons \\n\\nPro\\'s calesthenics:\\n* You train everything even small muscles like stability in your wrist or grip strength. \\n* Training sessions are usually much shorter with same exhaustion of the muscles afterwards (how I felt it)\\n* It\\'s like cardio and strength training in one\\n* You do have more functional strength\\n\\nCons:\\n*Training chest is difficult because after dips exercises become more difficult in stability and schouder rotation strength then pure pec strength like planche.\\n*Leg training is also hard because when you reach pistol squats. The only good ones are jumping squats and pistol squats.\\n\\nPro\\'s powerlifting:\\n*With squats and deadlifts your posture is rock solid. Which has benefits for a lot off aspects in my life.\\n*You do get really strong and feel powerfull. But only on certain lifts\\n \\nCons: \\n* If you want to train everything you are busy for 90 minutes or more \\n* I often forgot wrist strength and now my wrist sometimes hurt when using them to much\\n* If you don\\'t know how to balance your workouts you often have unbalanced physique(a lot off insecurity in self made programs)\\n* Full body is also difficult because in a single workout you train every muscle but not as it should (back: only vertical or horizontal pull. One of the 2 is missing)\\n\\nAlso research on adding calesthenics in gym workouts always leads to pure calesthenics, not with added lifts of the big 5.\\n\\nSo I was wondering if any of you have a calisthenics workout with added big lifts?\\n\\n\\nNot a native English speaker., BWF Daily Discussion and Beginner/RR Questions Thread for 2022-01-03 Welcome to the [r/bodyweightfitness]( daily discussion thread!\\n\\nFeel free to post beginner questions or just about anything that\\'s on your mind related to fitness!\\n\\n**Reminders:**\\n\\n* Read the [FAQ]( as your question may be answered there already.\\n* If you\\'re unsure how to start training, try the [BWF Primer Routine]( check out our [Recommended Routine]( or our more skills based routine: [Move](\\n* Even though the rules are relaxed here, asking for medical advice is still not allowed.\\n\\nJoin our live conversations on [Discord]( We\\'re also on [Facebook]( [Instagram]( and [Twitter](\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to look at previous Discussion threads, [click here.](, Split day work out help, Any workout recommendations?Basically I (21F if it matters) have never worked out in my life (other than for Sport in school, also when I was very little I did hip-hop, but I haven\\'t done that since I was 9 and 3 years ago I took fitness classes for about 3 months but that\\'s it)\\n\\nI don\\'t really have a problem keeping up with more intense workouts (I\\'m not sure, but everything I\\'ve tried I could do), but I\\'m always afraid that I\\'m doing it wrong.

The reason why I want to work out is because before the pandemic started I was a very active person. I\\'m a terrible driver, so I\\'d walk anywhere, even if it\\'s a 1-2 hour walk.  Now, my classes are online, my work is online, so that eliminates a lot of the walking. Surprisingly I haven\\'t really gained weight, but I also have a lot less appetite so maybe that\\'s why.

Living in a cold and rainy city, I often had to \"backup\" to a different at-home training for those days in which it is either too cold or raining too much. By doing this, I noticed that when I went back to RR, I of course had harder time to follow the same reps as I used to do before the forced stay-at-home situation.\\n\\nOne option would clearly be to go to a gym, but one of the reasons I chose bodyweight is that you don\\'t need a gym to exercise, and you can do it pretty much everywhere.\\n\\nSo my question is whether there is a good stay-at-home alternative to most of the RR exercises, depending on the path I have taken?

Gym Rings, Fitness was never enjoyable, why?, test, Study shows Chin-ups and Wide Grip Pull-ups pose higher risk of shoulder impingement over shoulder width Pull-ups[Scapula kinematics of pull-up techniques: Avoiding impingement risk with training changes](\\n\\n\\n\\nVery interesting. I\\'ve always known (and perhaps everyone here) that wide grip pull ups are dangerous for the shoulders. What got me is how the chin up is riskier than normal pull-ups. I was under the (wrong) impression that the external rotation from the chin-up created more space in the shoulder complex, thereby reducing the chances of shoulder impingement. I was wrong. Regular pull ups might be the way to go for anyone with shoulder impingement and those who want to avoid it. How about neutral grip pull ups?\\n\\n**TLDR:**  *High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk.*, M/19/5\\'11\\'\\' 1.5 Years Progress\\n\\nThis is a 1.5 year progress.

It was built under that premise that while consistency is key to achieving specific goals, enjoyment and (some) variety is crucial to a longer-term sustainable practice. It finally allows you to push the workout to your own Notion workspace for more permanent logging.\\n\\nYou specify the following criteria in each \"phase\":\\n\\n* Category {Push, Pull, Legs, Core, Movement, ...}\\n* Equipment {Rings, Paralettes, None, Parallel Bars, ...}\\n* Parent Exercise {Push-up, Dip, ...}\\n* N, the number of exercises to sample\\n* N Peak Intensity, the maximum number of \"peak intensity\" exercises of the N\\n\\n**Flow**: [Input Notion DB](  \\\\&gt;  [**Motus**](  \\\\&gt;  personal Notion DB *(optional)*\\n\\n# Features\\n\\n* Rich curated selection of calisthenics exercises publicly available in [Notion]( form cues, embedded videos guides, metadata including different intensities/whether the exercise is a \"peak intensity\" exercise.\\n* Export workouts to your own private Notion (using a lightning fast asynchronous implementation); copy to an Apple Note; or simply use as a web app in browser.\\n* Smartly orders your workout by 1) minimising the adjustment of ring heights and 2) placing peak intensity exercises toward the front.\\n* Manually reorder exercises via drag and drop.\\n* \"Pin\" specific exercises across generations that you know your body is craving.\\n\\n[\\n\\n[\\n\\n[\\n\\n## Why Notion as the source?\\n\\n* A UI that promotes editability and collaborative curation\\n* The ability to host **rich content**, form cues, and embed videos within pages\\n* The potential to clone others\\' DBs (ultimately to be able to plug in your own custom source)\\n* Support of semi-structured multi-select fields\\n\\n## Why Notion for the output?\\n\\n* Preserve rich content and form cues from the source\\n* Re-arrange the ordering of a workout easily\\n* Extend your personal Notion DB with additional logging columns\\n* Neatly store different workout permutations side-by-side\\n\\n# FAQ\\n\\n**Q: Why isn\\'t the ordering of exercises preserved in the Notion output?**\\n\\nA: Exercises are pushed *asynchronously* to Notion endpoints for a dramatic speed improvement. Rows can be sorted by sorting on the Order column in ascending order.\\n\\n**Q: Can the ordering of columns be set for the Notion output?**\\n\\nA: Currently Notion doesn\\'t appear to allow you to specify the order of properties when you create a DB schema - it places the Title property first and fields are alphabetically sorted thereafter. This order can be adjusted in Notion.\\n\\n**Q: Can the ordering of dropdown items be configured?**\\n\\nA: The ordering is preserved from the Notion input DB source. These can be adjusted by those with edit access.\\n\\n**Q: Why does the order of \"pinned\" exercises change on generation?**\\n\\nA: Motus preserves the exercise but still tries to sort the workout by ring height and by peak intensity. It\\'s possible/likely that the ordering of the pinned exercise will change.\\n\\n**Q: How is this implemented?**\\n\\nA: Motus is written in Python and running on Flask. Asyncio and  produce huge speed improvements when interacting with Notion; we avoid waiting on IO-blocking GET/PUSH requests as we pull and push 1) exercises (Notion pages) 2) exercise content (Notion child blocks) and 3) synced exercise content (Notion synced blocks that require further dereferencing)., Full Planche in 4 months - Will I make it?So I\\'ve decided to go on a little journey called \\'planche\\', the last major obstacle before I can call myself an advanced calisthenic athlete. And I\\'ve given myself 4 months to do it.\\n\\nThis is where I\\'m currently at (filmed end of December): \\n\\nThat was about RPE 7. Right now my balance gives out before my strength does (can\\'t even do a proper headstand for more than 8 seconds, another thing I will be working on), but I fully understand that my shoulder, chest and back strength is going to need a massive upgrade to pull this off.\\n\\nSo why 4 months? Because that\\'s what works best for me. I got my first iron cross after 4 months of specific training. Anything longer than that and I tend to burn out and regress, so 1/3 of a year for a strength training cycle is the best I can do.\\n\\nMy 4 month training cycle will go from being about 40/60 strength/hypertrophy that it is now to about 80/20 strength/hypertrophy, doubling my strength training volume. Basically, I\\'ll be training as a power lifter.\\n\\nI will also be working heavily on the antagonist muscles to avoid postural imbalances, which means I\\'ll also be training heavy for front lever and p-bar victorian, but after I do my planche block in the training session.\\n\\nThis will be the first time I share my calisthenic training journey with anyone and I mainly wrote this post to hold myself accountable (so no slacking off!!) and maybe get some tips and support from you guys. I\\'ll be doing monthly updates until month 4, so stay tuned., Brand new to working out, Tips for Getting Back into Groove Post New Born and Extensive BreakSo my wife and i had our first child last June. Before then, we have always been avid fitness people, working out 4-5/week. When Covid hit, we moved to BWF and followed the RR. We saw some amazing results from it and i fell in love with this style of working out. \\n\\nA year and a half later since starting the RR, our baby finally came and I thought it would be an awesome time for a break. The plan was to take a month off and then get back at it. Well, as the old saying goes, \"the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray\". The first month came and went, then 2, then 4, then now finally 6. \\n\\nBefore the baby, I honestly can\\'t remember the last time i went even a week without working out in some way and I definitely feel it. But trying to manage the balance of a kid and working out is.... challenging. Aside from the fact i feel demotivated because i feel I lost alot of progress in that time.\\n\\nAnyway, i\\'m thinking about starting a split routine for easing back in and time constraints.

I have not managed to isolate which exact muscle is the problem, but I\\'ve noticed that moves that demand strength while being in heavy shoulder internal rotation, moves that force a \"chicken wing\" arm position as well as some gastons often induce a sharp pain at the back of my shoulder (which sometimes resorbs itself quickly, and sometimes lasts for a few days). It feels like a muscular issue more than tendon or ligament related, so I suspect weakness in one or several muscles of the shoulder complex, but I\\'m unsure which.\\n\\nHere are a few photos of positions that I reckon would probably cause me discomfort or pain:\\n\\n[ (the right arm position)\\n\\n[\\n\\nI do calisthenics besides bouldering, and my upper body routine usually revolves around a few skills + the 4 basics (chin-ups or pull-ups, bodyweight rows, pushups or dips, pike push-ups). I consider my scapular stability to be pretty good in the context of calisthenics, and the only \"imbalance\" I have noticed is that I believe my overhead pressing strength (pike push-ups) to be slightly lacking compared to the other 3 movements.\\n\\nI have not done any dedicated rotator cuff training so far, but I think I may need to start doing some to prevent more shoulder pain and potentially serious injuries down the road.

It has been an incredible journey this past year and a half exercising with minimal equipment and I am still learning g things. \\n\\nA recent one I realized was to emphasize biceps more I take a broom, wrap towels on each end so the handle does not damage anything, and hold it outside of a doorway, letting the covered parts rest against the frame. Then I can lean away from it and curl myself only koving forearms, I feel way more focus on my biceps\\n\\nAll the variations we can do with minimal equipment has made me realize that anyone can exercise, you dont need a gym membership, just be willing to get creative. This has also changed a lot in how I prescribe exercises for my clients, Front lever rows and scapular retractionI want to see what everyone’s opinions are on the front lever row for full range strength training, specifically scapular retraction.\\n\\nI value the FL row due to its crossover to static FL and as a counterbalance to horizontal pushing work.\\n\\nBut recently as I’ve been working on fixing some postural issues (rounded shoulders, scapular winging, impingement) I’ve noticed how the FL row doesn’t allow full ROM (range of motion) because it is almost impossible to properly retract at the bottom of the movement. \\n\\nMy pull work pretty much revolves exclusively around FL work and chin-ups. But neither of these movements build scapular retraction (am I correct?). So does that mean that your average calisthenics push-pull program  (assuming mine is average) is not effectively balanced since it never allows for full scapular retraction training?\\n\\nWould love to hear your thoughts?, What would the ideal push pull legs workout be with no equipment need to start exercising again, Training with a weighted vest.Hello,\\n\\n I am considering getting a weighted vest for a while now, since I am not interested in building skills by performing more complex moves and I only care about health, aesthetics and strength. I have been training in calisthenics for a few months in a disciplined manner (3 times a week, decent quality training programme, decent quality diet), and a couple years in an undisciplined one (low quality training programmes, weeks and occasionally months of not training due to low morale, low quality diet). \\n\\n I believe that a weighted vest will offer more gains in all aspects, and will achieve it in less time than pure bodyweight exercise, however I want to be sure I am making the right choice and that it is worth it before acquiring one, since they are costly.\\n\\n In case it matters, my level as of now is something like this: Can perform 30 consecutive push ups with good form, can perform 50 consecutive squats with good form, can perform 10 consecutive neutral grip pull ups with good form, can perform 100 consecutive sit ups with good form.\\n\\n So my questions are:\\n\\n• Good/best time to start using one? (Right from the beginning vs after you\\'ve gotten a level of familiarity with calisthenics).\\n\\n• How many kilograms should one start with?

Maybe missed maybe a day or 2 since only to let fresh tattoos heal up.\\n\\nSome days I will do bodyweight training and run immediately after (I have a treadmill at home) but I will always take a quick break and eat a bowl of oatmeal with walnuts and a banana before I start my run as to try and avoid burning any sort of muscle. I also eat before I workout as well but that varies. Typically greek yogurt. Normally I have had breakfast, lunch and snacks during the day before I do my training so I don\\'t worry much about eating before hand. If I do it\\'s maybe a scoop of PB and a greek yogurt.\\n\\nAfter I run my cooldown is typically walking the dog like I mentioned earlier.\\n\\nRight now I\\'m just a little torn on what I\\'d like to do moving forward. Personally I\\'d like to go on a cut and drop more weight because I feel as if I picked up a fair amount of strength and muscle gains but am somewhat skinny fat so I feel like I need to get my BF% lower so I can actually physically see how hard I\\'ve worked this year.\\n\\nAm I getting enough rest time? My workout feels pretty intense, that coupled with the running and walking I\\'m doing feels like a lot. Does the workout seem like too much or not enough?\\n\\nAny comments/suggestions/critique welcome. \\nI know I did touch base too hard on my diet but if anyone needs any of that detail I\\'m happy to provide some insight.\\nThanks, Scapula injury after holding front lever for a few seconds., Best Follow-along YouTube Workout Channels?, Follow-along YouTube Workout Channels RecommendationsHi there!

I was setting out some goals for 2022. One of these was the Front lever. After doing some research I discovered that I needed to strengthen my pull strength (current pull up PR is 10 reps) and core strength. Just to state I absolutely love working out and I have no problem being motivated. This shouldn\\'t take me a few months before starting out on the proper front lever progressions but I was wondering if u thought mastering the front lever was a realistic goal for 2022 or am I being set up for disappointment?, Is my Front Lever goal realistic?, Do PPPU work Upper Chest or Lower Chest?So, I\\'m 16 year old and I\\'ve been training for 4 months and I tried doing PPPU 2 days ago and I feel soreness in my Upper Chest as well as a little soreness in Lower Chest, so my question is does PPPU works Upper Chest more or Lower Chest cause some people say it works Lower Chest more and some say the other one, cause I need to build my Upper Chest as of now and if PPPU doesn\\'t work Upper Chest can you guys also tell me some alternatives for Upper Chest and of Lower Chest also, of course calisthenics only cause I can\\'t afford a gym or weights and also I don\\'t a have bars to do dips, but I have one pull up bar, so can you guys help me out?, Restarting Training, need some help/advice.Its been a while since I posted in this subreddit. But over the last,4-6 months I’ve been recovering from an injury I sustained whilst playing football. After loads of rehab I’m back to being able to play competitively, although I’m probably at 70% match fitness. In the time I did not Calisthenics or any sort of resistance training. Now, since getting back to it and I’ve been doing the RR (Recommended Routine) for about 6 weeks, and I’ve progressed pretty quickly and I’m back to doing weighed pull ups and weighted dips. \\n\\nOver the time I was not training, I looked over my previous training and thought I’d change it up so I can learn to FL and Planche in 2022 - or at least get the FL by this time next year. I know the Planche is quite hard, so that may take 2 years at bare minimum. So I’m seeking some advice on programming and routine structure. I know Steve is planning to release an app sometime soon, but in the meantime I need some advice. My plan is to train towards my Calisthenic goals about 3x a week, with 1 or sessions of legs per week (depending on football ⚽️ training). So here is an outline of my plan after I do another two weeks of the RR.\\n\\nMonday &amp; Friday \\n\\n1. Warm up and Mobility (15 mins) \\n2. FL and Planche Statics \\n3. FL Rows + PPPUs\\n4. Pull Ups + Pike Push Ups\\n\\nWednesday:\\n\\n1. Warm up and Mobility (15 mins) \\n2. FL and Planche Statics \\n3. FL Raises + Tuck L-sit to Tuck Planche \\n4. Bicep Isolation  + Shoulder/Tricep Isolation\\n\\nOne idea is too alternate each week which workout I do once or twice in that week.In the example above, I do Wednesdays workout on Monday &amp; Friday and take the former and do it on Wednesday. Changing it each week \\n\\nAn alternative routine would be to have a Planche and FL day. \\n\\nMonday and Thursday:\\n\\n1. Tuck Planche Hold (5-10 seconds) X4 2. Planche Lean (15 seconds) X4\\n3. Tuck L-Sit To Tuck Planche (5) X5\\n4. PPPUs (5) X5\\n5. Pike Push ups (6-10) X5\\n\\nTuesday and Friday: \\n\\n1. Tuck Front Lever Hold (5-10 seconds) X4 2. 2. Tuck Front Lever Raises (2-4) X4\\n3. FL Rows (1) X7\\n4. Pull Ups (5-8) X4\\n5. Hollow Body Hold (30sec) X4 and/or bicep isolation\\n\\nAnother alternative, instead of doing legs on a sperate days, is to throw in a maximum of 2 leg exercises at the end of each workout similar to how the RR has squats and RDLs. That way I can work on my Planche and FL training, whilst still making leg gains and leaving the other days to do more drill/technique based training for my soccer or focussing on improving my mobility (such as ankle mobility) which is terrible. \\n\\nAm I doing too much., How can I make a workout plan or what can I do to gain strength as a beginner?, Help with mobilityHello guys, and a happy new year to everyone. \\n\\nSo I’m just posting about help with mobility. Since I started Calisthenics, I’ve noticed I have very poor mobility, which has probably lead to some injuries. For example, I cannot for the life of me sit in deep squat due to poor ankle mobility. When I do the 5 inch wall test, my knee is probably about 2 inches away from touching the wall - basically need another 2inches of ankle mobility. In general I’m a stiff person, especially in my lower body. I play quite a bit of soccer, and I have noticed that I really struggle to hit high volleys (Zidane 2002 UCL final) cause of tight hips, and I really struggle with the L-sit cause of poor compression and possibly tight and weak hip flexors.\\n\\nSo I was wondering, are there any good mobility programs out there that you would recommend. I know there are channels like Tom Merrick on YouTube, but there is so much information out there that it’s a struggle to colate all of it and create a program that can help me. There’s even the kneesovertoes guy who’s program I’ve heard is good at helping people gain lower body mobility and strength.\\n\\nAll opinions/help is welcomed.

Thus I always end a climbing session with a full body workout, and I run on my off days. \\nI recently read \"overcoming gravity\", and became even more interested in balancing my workouts. This book answered a lot of questions regarding bodyweight fitness. \\n\\nHowever by doing a few spartan races, I noticed, not surprisingly, that I struggled with weights. My legs shake a bit, and I don\\'t feel very confident in these obstacles. I think of the spartan races as a recap of my overall fitness. So weighted obstacles being a big weakness, I thought that maybe implementing a few weightlifting exercices into my routine would help me fill this gap. I was thinking about deadlift, bench and maybe squats.\\n\\nNow, **by no means do I want to be a world class climber, break running records or become a strongman.** I just want to be a balanced athlete, with no big weakness that could lead to injury. Weightlifting and bodyweight training as I see them are tools that could help me reach that goal.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I was at a gym earlier today, this place has a great boulder area, as well as an area with multiple pull up bars, and also a few \"cages\" for weightlifting. Coaches there are either specialized in bodyweight training or weightlifting.\\nI climbed a bit, then went into a bodyweight workout, and then, as I felt still pretty fresh, asked a coach to help me learn the technique for deadlifts since I\\'ve never done those.\\nHe basically said it was useless for my practice, and could even deteriorate my running and climbing game.\\n\\n**Hence the question : is implementing weightlifting exercices a bad idea for someone trying to be balanced ?**, Got some question about my current bodyweight routine, any answer will be appreciatedHi everyone, 23 yo male here.

You can spend one minute total doing this or less.  So you end up with 6 sets easy.\\n\\nCaveat.  If you find you feel the performance diminished within the day where you cant do it as intense.  Stop.

I’m 16 years old, male, and weigh 150lbs. I’m have a “Skinny-Fat” physique. So I’ve been trying to get back into fitness recently, and I’ve decided that starting on the 1st I will start working out every day and try to reach my “dream physique” by the end of May. I have a lot of resolutions I plan to keep throughout the new year, and so I’m really trying to keep my motivation up and make it to may with that goal in mind. My dream physique is an overall more defined and built muscles all around, as well as a six pack( if that’s possible lol). I got skinny forearms and calves that I’m really self conscious about, so I really want to bulk those up too. Last year I was really skinny, I weighed 80lbs and was a twig. I dirty bulked up to 150, and I worked out up until school started, which I then stopped and my physique that I gained was gone, as well as the ability to do normal workouts like push ups and pull ups. Now that I’m planning on starting to workout again, I need help finding a workout program that’ll get me to my goal by the end of may. I have 10,15,20,&amp;25 lbs weights, a pull-up bar, a strong resistance and that I can use, along with multiple grip strengtheners. I know the first thing in getting fit is diet, so eating healthy and tracking my calories is something I already hav planned out, but I still need a workout plan. Rn I’m thinking of trying out Igor voitenkos plans, but I really need something that’ll help me reach my goals by the end of may. I like planning things out and knowing what workouts I’m gonna do in advance, bc it is overall easier for me to stick to something if I already have a plan. So if there are any apps or workout programs that you recommend pls lmk, as I’m trying to get into the best shape of my life this year., Alternatives to crunches. Hey guys,\\n\\nI started my fitness journey by doing 100 crunches and 2 sets of 45 sec plank. After the first day, my back was sore and it would hurt whenever I would bend to pick up something from the floor/ground. Idk why that is so I did some research on google and there was a harvad study that elucidated that crunches can make your back sore. Then I saw some alternatives to crunches that are easier on your back. However, there are so many people who do crunches every day without worrying about back pain.

Unfortunately too many people don\\'t do the **intensity** part.  Most people can build a lot of health strength this way.  Intense exercise is actually more efficient  at triggering autophagy and apoptosis than fasting.\\n\\n\"There is definitely a \"too little\" and a \"too much\" when it comes  to intense exercise.  See the section about Hormesis.  Build gradually,  but don\\'t be afraid of a little pain,  especially sore muscles.  Build your determination so that you  celebrate when you get to an authentic **failure**, when you simply  can\\'t push or pull any longer.  Sometimes when I \"fail\" doing push-ups, my arms are so tired and so weak that I have to  roll over on my side and use my elbows to get up, while chuckling to  myself at what a victory that was.  Don\\'t shy away from very long rest periods during the day.  The point of HIIT  (**H**igh **I**ntensity **I**nterval **T**raining, the best  way to exercise) is that you can put everything into your exercise.  Easy cardio is better than nothing,  but it does not qualify as intense exercise.  Intensity is the secret.  Intense exercise is insanely good for one\\'s willpower, about on par with cold showers. \\t   [ Dr. Peter Attia, MD on Joe Rogan.](  Peter tells us in this podcast that intense exercise is the single best  \\'drug\\' for health and longevity. \\t   \\t\\n\\n\"I actually spend very little time exercising.  I would guess  that perhaps 20 minutes per day, scattered all across the day.  But  those 20 minutes are down right heroic, like 100 push-ups in less than 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I  am resting.  Without adequate recovery, lots of people fail to progress.   I can\\'t tell you how many young people I\\'ve seen on YouTube who complain that they aren\\'t getting the  gains that they were hoping for, when they do 100 push-ups (or more)  every day.  They aren\\'t giving themselves time to recover.  If your muscles still hurt, then rest.   This isn\\'t rocket science.  It **IS** being excessively yang,  pushing one\\'s self too hard and not allowing for recovery, which is an inherently yin or parasympathetic process.   No one should do intensity on the same muscle group day after day after  day.  Every other day is quite  sufficient. \\t   \\t\\n\\n\"The new punishment for sloth is no longer eternal damnation.

I was that skinny Asian kid and wanted to get big. So I started doing 100 push ups every morning. I was told it would change my life…. Here are the results:\\n\\nAfter month 1, I started noticing some definition in my pecs. It was a massive struggle reaching 100 every day but I wasn’t going to give up. After month 2, my chest definitely looked visibly bigger - but I was actually surprised to see my arms and shoulders looked a lot bigger too. After month 3, the workout became a lot easier and I couldn’t believe how much stronger I had become. The speed of my upper body growth was honestly insane to me. There’s me thinking I needed a gym to get big!\\n\\nSo back to present day, I decided to create my own version of a 100 push up workout. It contains 10 different push up variations, targeting different parts of your chest, so I think it’s better (and more varied) than just doing 100 regular push ups. I honestly think this will help some people out there trying to build muscle for the first time. I know it did for me. \\n\\nHope you find it helpful, and would love to get some feedback on the YouTube channel too!\\n\\n[Link to my video](, Body Shaking during workoutIs this normal?! (35 f) in the past year I\\'ve lost 60 lbs. I haven\\'t lost any weight in the past 2 months. So recently maybe 3 weeks now I started you tube HIIT and strength and body weight videos every morning . Usually 30 mins long. I haven\\'t been able to keep up with the person doing the video but I give it my all. Have even added some 10 or 15 lb weights in sometimes. So I guess I have 2 questions. Does anyone shake? Like whatever part of the body I\\'m working out after a few reps I\\'m shaking. Or am I just that bad out of shape? Lol also did anyone just stop losing weight when they started adding weights into their workout? Before when I started to lose weight I only dieted and walked.

I have never worked out my arms, even though I dabbled with cardio for a while and I felt motivated to start. I quickly realized that I can’t do one push-up, which wasn’t a big deal at first since this was expected. Though I can barley do one knee push-up either (which I had before), I’ve been working out with a focus on my arms for about two weeks now and I see no results.

How can I fix this?Few days ago I posted here that I’m interested in starting a body weight routine and looking forward to starting soon. I got some satisfying answers but the there’s one thing I need to figure out how to fix before I start. \\n\\nFew months ago I went to the gym and started lifting again after not going for a year and a half. Now note that I’ve always been a couch potato. Constant gaming and film watching. 24 years old , 6’4 ft fall btw. I’ve never been constant at the gym mostly because of college , which I already graduated from. \\n\\nWhen I started lifting, my sleep went to complete shit. I normally sleep 12:30 to 7:30 p.m. sometimes until 8:30. I strongly cherish my sleep, mainly because in my late teens, early 20s I struggled with sleeping. Falling asleep has never even an issue but staying asleep for 7-8 hours was. I would sleep at 12 then wake up a 4 or 5 and couldn’t fall back asleep for another 2-3 hours, leading to being late a work and such. Thankfully now I have better sleeping habits.\\n\\nBut when I started exercising I went back to that shitty sleeping habit.I worked out on a Monday, fell asleep at 12 and woke up at 5:30. Couldn’t fall back asleep. At all. Tuesday I work out again and it was even worse cause I woke up at 4 in the morning that night. Felt like complete shit so I didn’t workout that day. And it that sleeping pattern continued until Sunday. I stopped working out after Tuesday but the sleeping pattern continued. It’s like my body is so used to be fucking lazy that it rejected fucking exercising or something. \\n\\nSome have said it’s because I worked out in the evening but that wouldn’t make sense because like I said it continued even on days I didn’t work out. Monday night things went back to normal thankfully and I haven’t exercised since. This happened to me last summer as well. \\n\\nWhat is the issue and how can I fix it? I’m sure it’s like some hormone/adrenaline thing because guess what, when spider man no way home came out, I was fucking excited for the movie and anxious id be spoiled for it that I woke up at 4:30 am and couldn’t fall back asleep at all either.

I will appreciate any advice how to adjust RR to make further progress and not dying after workout. Maybe longer brakes between sets? I don\\'t know. Of course I will appreciate advice on any other good program there with good references. My main goal is have very strong core to avoid back pain which I didn\\'t have since starting RR.

Depending on how it goes maybe add Kettlebell Swings in the future. \\n\\nI work from home, have all the equipment I need and have plenty of time on my hands. So I could easily do each exercise one per hour. I could even separate out the 2 upper and lower body exercises eg: Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, (wait 30 mins), Dips, Kettlebell Swings, (wait 30 mins), repeat.  \\n\\nI’d also do some light cardio after work just once a day, taking rest days from this as needed. I\\'d say I\\'m currently at an intermediate level., Greasing the groove saved me (34M) post surgery.WARNING: long read. So almost a year ago now I went into surgery for multiple injuries to my bicep and shoulder. It all started as a result of a 10 year old workplace injury, but as time marched on it led to more issues. I got bicep tenodesis surgery, shoulder labrum surgery, and had my collar bone shaved so they could clean up my ACL along with the bursas drained.  \\n\\nFrankly, post surgery was awful. I’ll save you those details. It’ll suffice to say when I was cleared to start working out regularly (after following my physical therapy to a T) I did. But I was so embarrassed at my strength. I left the gym one day and cried in my car because of how weak I became compared to others. I couldn’t go back.\\n\\nThe toughest part was losing pull ups, my favorite exercise. I majorly struggled with pull ups, one because all that upper body strength was gone, but two because mentally I felt I couldn’t start over again. And then, as if a light bulb turned on, I remembered greasing the groove. \\n\\nSo that’s what I did. I started hanging from the bar a few times a day. Shit, even that took work. Then I’d attempt one pull up. Then two. Then three. Then four. And so on. Knowing I wasn’t going anywhere near failure gave me the space to accept my weakness, because I knew I’d just try again later. And it felt so easy, so accessible, that not only was that mental block gone, but the strength to do full pull ups bounced right back. \\n\\nI still have some issues. Push ups are taking a long time to recover. And some exercises still feel funny. But without greasing the groove, I don’t know if I’d ever have gotten the confidence back to just…try. \\n\\nSo with that said, thanks. I don’t know where I’d be without such a simple concept. \\n\\nTL;dr: GTG helped my recovery, Calisthenics + Weights Workout Routine Push/Pull/LegsI\\'ve loved incorporating calisthenics into my workout routine. When I train calisthenics, I feel better, less aches, and more confident about my mobility. My strength is also more symmetrical. Gymnastic rings are my favorite workout tools. But, weights and machines have a very important role in strength and fitness. In my case, I feel like weights add more mass, as it is usually easier to progressively overload. They are also very useful in isolating muscle groups.\\n\\nI wanted to create a workout routine that mixes traditional bodybuilding principles and excercises, while also adding calisthenics. The goal for this routine is muscular hypertrophy. In the past, I\\'ve used calisthenic skills for warmups, and have seen very good results as long as I don\\'t overdo it. The volume for this routine is relatively high, as I am an intermediate lifter/athlete. \\n\\nAs of right now, I have a shoulder injury (calcification in my rotator cuff), which worsens with heavy bench press exercises. Ring chest excercises feel great though. So, I am limiting my bench press exercises. \\n\\nThe routine is a Push/Pull/Legs split. I use bands for the warmup/skill portions.\\n\\n**PUSH 1**\\n\\n||EXERCISE|SETS|REPS|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|WARMUP|Handstand Hold|3|30 seconds|\\n|CHEST|Ring Dip|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|CHEST|Ring Archer Pushup|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|CHEST (Fly)|Ring Fly|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|SHOULDER|Handstand Pushup (Back against the wall)|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|SHOULDER|Dumbbell/Cable Lateral Raise|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|TRICEP|Ring Tricep Extension|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|TRICEP|Cable Tricep Pushdown|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|TRICEP|Cable Single Arm Tricep Extension|3|10 - 12 Reps|\\n|ABS|Hanging Leg Raise|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n\\n**PULL 1**\\n\\n||EXERCISE|SETS|REPS|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|WARMUP|Front Lever Holds|3|20 seconds|\\n|BACK|Ring Chin Up|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|BACK|Wide Grip Lat Pulldown|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|BACK|Dumbbell Row|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|TRAP|Dumbbell Shrug|2|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|REAR DELT|Ring Rear Delt Fly|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|BICEP|Barbell Bicep Curl|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|BICEP|Seated Dumbbell Curl|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|BICEP|Ring Bicep Curl|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|ABS|Ring Ab Rollout |3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n\\n**LEGS 1**\\n\\n||EXERCISE|SETS|REPS|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|WARMUP|Walking Lunge|2|20 Reps (per leg)|\\n|HINGE|Barbell Squat|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|SINGLE LEG|Bulgarian Squat|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|QUAD|Leg Extension|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|HAMSTRING|Leg Curl|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|GLUTE|Hip Thrust|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|CALF|Weighted Calf Raises|4|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|ABS|Weighted Medicine Ball Crunch|3|15 - 20 Reps|\\n\\n**PUSH 2**\\n\\n||EXERCISE|SETS|REPS|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|WARMUP|Planche Holds|3|20 seconds|\\n|CHEST|Ring Bulgarian Pushup|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|CHEST|Incline Dumbbell Bench Press|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|CHEST (Fly)|Cable Fly|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|SHOULDER|Handstand Pushup (Facing the wall)|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|SHOULDER|Dumbbell/Cable Lateral Raise|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|TRICEP|Machine Tricep Dip|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|TRICEP|Tricep Rope Pushdown|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|TRICEP|Overhead Cable Cable Extension|3|10 - 12 Reps|\\n|ABS|Hanging Leg Raise|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n\\n**PULL 2**\\n\\n||EXERCISE|SETS|REPS|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|WARMUP|Front Lever Holds|3|20 seconds|\\n|BACK|Mantle Ring Chin Up|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|BACK|Archer Ring Row|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|BACK|Dumbbell Row|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|TRAP|Dumbbell Shrug|2|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|REAR DELT|Ring Face Pull|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|BICEP|Dumbbell Bicep Concentration Curl|3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|BICEP|Cable Bicep Curl|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|BICEP|Ring Pelican Curl|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|ABS|Ring Ab Rollout |3|12 - 15 Reps|\\n\\n**LEGS 2**\\n\\n||EXERCISE|SETS|REPS|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|WARMUP|Walking Lunge|2|20 Reps (per leg)|\\n|HINGE|Barbell Deadlift|3|6 - 10 Reps|\\n|SINGLE LEG|Pistol Squat|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|QUAD|Leg Extension|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|HAMSTRING|Leg Curl|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|GLUTE|Glute Bridge|3|8 - 12 Reps|\\n|CALF|Seated Calf Raises|4|12 - 15 Reps|\\n|ABS|Weighted Medicine Ball Crunch|3|15 - 20 Reps|, How to easily loss your weight ., Back exercises not including pull ups, , My progression over the year 2021So I am a teenager who was merely overweight. I used to weight around 83 kg. At the start of 2021 I decided to make a change and so I did I started working out at home very minimally. I was dropping weight. I was only doing cardio and not resistance training. Throught my journey until October I lost roughly 20 kg. But as I toned down my body fat percentage I quickly realized that I should start training for muscle growth. So I started doing calisthenics at home and also started bulking( eating in a surplus) Since then I gained 2 kg of weight( mainly muscle).

And then I take a 2 min break - and try to do the 2nd set but cant go beyond 5-6. Subsequent sets are worse and I try to get to 8 reps each set by bending my legs and reducing the length of my outstretched body.\\n\\nI\\'ve been stuck at this for about 6 weeks now - but I know I\\'ve progressed in some other aspects (like I can 2 band assisted pull ups with proper form, previously I couldnt do even one)\\n\\nIs there a way to understand if this is normal? Am I being impatient? Maybe I am, but I dont have much of a reference point on how slow/fast progressions should be. \\n\\nI\\'m obese, 5\\'9\\'\\' and 204lbs. My diet is I\\'d say around 80-90% controlled. I used to 220lbs a few months ago - so at least something is working in my diet., Minimalists unite! What\\'s your minimalist routine?I\\'m a firm believer of \"mental sustainability\" for long-term success; so many people go through a \"beastmode\" phase of their lives where they hit the gym/workouts hard, to the max, then ultimately just burnout. Seeing an extended laundry list of movements in a routine is such a turnoff for me. Considering the large of muscles compound movements hit, I never felt it necessary to have such a long list. My own:\\n\\n- Chinups:  Narrow-grip/hollowbody. I\\'ve completely stopped doing pullups in favor of chins. At the very last rep of a set, I hold at the very top to allow the biceps/core put in some extra work. Try it! These builds some pretty awesome abs. \\n\\n- Dips: Often with 35lbs between the legs. It\\'s fun knowing that my pecs which I\\'ve been complimented on in a few occasions were built using my mom\\'s plastic medical walker. It sits in my room since it takes up practically no space so I can crank out some reps on a complete whim; convenient, amazing.\\n\\n- Legs: Got me here. I\\'m lazy in this department. Sometimes it\\'s goblet squats, air squats, BSS. Finally mastering the pistol squat so this may be my new lazy movement here, in between my occasional hikes.\\n\\n- ETC: Kettlebells. Walmart had some on the cheap earlier in the year so I\\'ll occasionally do a few cleans/rows, whatever. Just some random spontaneous movements for functional strength building. \\n\\nThat\\'s pretty much it. Not the most exciting routine but it keeps me consistent for sure., Need help, Endurance training on off daysThis is a question that\\'s already been asked multiple times but with exercises that still feel like you are doing strength or volume training rather than endurance.\\n\\nIn my case I\\'d like to train on off days just for the sake of increasing numbers. Right now I can do about 8 HSPU per 4 sets, today I checked and I can only do 36 normal push ups which is not really that much compared to before I started doing calisthenics. With calisthenics my strength and hypertrophy gains are notorious but it seems I didn\\'t improve in the endurance aspect.\\n\\nMy primary goal is strength and progressing on calisthenics movements (currently pursuing planche and front lever) and endurance comes second.\\n\\nSo, doing something like 2x35 reps of push ups on off days just for the sake of, one day, being able to do 50 reps interfere with my current strength progress? I\\'m an office worker, I pass 8hr/day in front of the computer and I don\\'t really do any kind of exercise other than my strength routine 3 times a week., Do you want to lose weight in a healthy and safe way?, Recommended equipment for weighted pullups at home?First of all, I hope this is the right place for this post.

For example, in Steven Low\\'s book \"Overcoming gravity\", it is stated: \"The simplest method to maintain shoulder structural balance involves utilizing pull and push exercises, which will offset one another. This will allow you to maintain a healthy balance of strength and hypertrophy at the shoulder\".\\n\\nBut what are exactly the consequences of an imbalance, especially doing almost only pushing? Can it be a real issue or is it just a matter of preferences? Or maybe, this push/pull method is too simple and reality is more complex?\\n\\nI think it is a common imbalance as pushing exercises are easier to put in place: they require no bars or equipment. It can be trained with the floor only., Strength / Health / Gains long-term post tonsillectomyHey all, had my tonsils removed 11 days ago for recurring strep infections.

Been training with the rr for almost a year now. Went from 0 pullups to 12 solid reps on rings and from 12 really poor pushups to 20 pushups with solid form. I\\'m looking to start training with adding weight to these movements. But seeing as I have no experience with traditional strength training I\\'m not really sure how to program this.\\n\\nI was thinking of doing a ppl split so that on each upper day I can focus all my energy into the weighted movement + some accessories. \\n\\nI was thinking something like this for the workouts.\\n\\nPush: Weighted pushups, db ohp, some tricep isolation and additional shoulder work. (Lu raises and external rotation exercises)\\n\\nPull: Weighted pullups. Ring face pulls, ring rows, bicep curls, some forearm isolation too. Probably reverse wrist curls and finger curls.\\n\\nFor reps and sets, I know what to do for the accessories. It\\'s the weighted movements I\\'m unsure of. I plan on starting with 5kgs on each movement and seeing how it feels. But beyond that I\\'m not sure. Any advice would be appreciated!!, Full at home routinesDoes anybody know of some all at home routines, requiring minimal amounts of equipment?

Just the the look of it, not the feeling for obvious reasons. \\n\\n\\nSo I was standing in the gym stretched between two cable machines facing each other (cross over pulls set-up) with my arms locked straight. It felt like dead hang with arms pulled to the side. I was able to do \"active hang\" as well as very limited range scapular pulls. I experimented for a while with amount of loaded weight to the point I had trouble getting hold of both cables.  \\n\\n\\nThis morning I did a unilateral version on rings. So I laid on the floor on my side and grabbed a ring above, and just hang on it doing sort of a \"\\'hanging\\' side-plank.\"\\n\\n\\nI could do both passive hang and active hang and a little scapular motion as well, and then I stopped abruptly in fear that this could be one of those moments of stupidity when one get injured and ends up with a dislocated shoulder. \\n\\n\\nSo I wanted to see if any of you have experience with this \"stretch\" and if it\\'s any different than a dead hang or if it overlaps too much or not safe enough to be worth considering.\\n\\nThan You., How to use rings?, Single leg exercises, Full body daily workout I can do in half an hour?, Can I keep training my muscles if I feel sore, or do I rest?, Having trouble getting started, Shredded by September after surgery?Hey all, hope everyone is having a great holiday. \\n\\nI\\'ve lurked here for a bit and have done a fair amount of my own research before starting the Recommended Routine. Unfortunately, right when I was getting into it in the fall (had a lot of time off while transitioning jobs) I ruptured my Achilles. \\n\\nRecovery has been slow and steady and I can put some weight on the leg now, but I think in general I\\'ll be taking sports or anything with explosive movements off the table for 2022 until I get the confidence in my agility back. \\n\\nI\\'d like to get back into the Recommended Routine, with the caveat being that even exercises that don\\'t directly exercise the leg still involve it in some way (getting up to or down from the pull up bar, contact with ground for push-ups, etc). My main motivation is looking good for my wedding in September (and of course, being healthier in general). \\n\\nOf course I\\'ll be talking to my physical therapist about ramping up my activity level, but I wanted to see if this sub had any thoughts too as it generally seems to be one of the most helpful and supportive places I lurk on this website. \\n\\nI know there will be an influx of advice seeking with the new year, so any help on getting back on this journey would be truly appreciated! Happy new year to everyone!, Bodyweight chestAs a skinny dude I\\'ve always wanted a chest. Despite that, my priorities in fitness are efficiency and convenience.\\n\\nI started in bodyweight by doing some pushups throughout the day. Even after reaching high reps I noticed hardly any visible muscles. I tried diamonds and other variations in hand placement. The minor changes brought minor rewards. Decline pushups could help but the slight inversion, deltoid requirement, and variables in feet/hips/hand/head placement kills the fun without enough chest reward.\\n\\nSo, I bought some straps and tried flys only to quit early for a few reasons. Flys require straight arm strength to be effective while not necessarily helping to establish that strength. This means I would have to gain a capability that I don\\'t quite value before I might be able to perform an isolated movement. Secondly, the ROM for flys is absurd compared to other movements such as a pushup. The arms can either spread beyond their working limit or they can narrow to a point of imbalance. Sure these are avoidable but again the cost is high for an isolated movement. Lastly, I see it as an ineffective attempt to replicate a gym machine so that more people buy straps.\\n\\nEventually I wandered into a gym routine and experimented with total body fitness. I decided to work on dips starting with bench, then bands at the dip station, then varied positioning at the station. Then I moved to the rings for support holds, then negatives, then my first few shaky red-faced ring dips.\\n\\nWith only a small volume those ring dips were grinding through my shoulders, so I started warming up with shoulder dislocates. Just like flys, the ROM was silly and the movement felt too isolated to be effective.\\nEverything changed when I started Skin the Cats. Versus shoulder dislocates I was getting a more effective warmup in a fraction of the time. If I focused on keeping my legs straight and slowing the movement then I would also get some chest pump, specifically when exiting the German Hang.\\n\\nSTC let me safely increase my ring dip volume. I was mainly seeing tricep and stabilizer activation but not enough chest.  I tried targeting my chest by \"leaning forward\" based on internet advice. However, I felt no real difference and my form was suffering. When I returned to strictly vertical form the depth in my range of motion began to increase. Beyond 5 reps at maximum depth (hands to armpits) my chest was finally getting pumped.\\nBased on my personal experience I think there is a common misunderstanding around the role of the pectorals. The lower pecs, larger than the upper, are used to move the elbows from behind the back to beside the ribs. Both STC and full-depth ring dips include this motion.\\n\\nBy only working the lower pecs I was effectively growing moobs. The space halfway between my collarbone and my nipple remained unfilled. I was still happy to have something but the longing for that complete chest persisted.\\n\\nFor some upcoming travel, I wanted a program that required less gear. Without my beloved rings I needed something for the upper body other than an excessive amount of gimmicky pushups.\\n\\nI prefer bodyweight fitness for mobility and a habit that can be independent of weights. Without adding weight and without ROM limitations like \"wide\" variants, bodyweight progression requires unilateral movement. I already use split squats and archer rows, so what\\'s the unilateral variant of a travel-friendly upper body compound exercise?\\n\\nI started doing archer pushups and I feel the same mental leap that came with STC and ring dips. Archer pushups are difficult, compound, and they use a complete yet controlled ROM. They hit my triceps hard while also hitting some back and shoulders due to the side-to-side motion, which does not exist for other pushups. The additional activation is because I can push or pull myself from one side to the other, though I am still figuring out how to control whether the transition is more of a push or pull.\\n\\nFocusing on that lateral motion makes it difficult for me to hold the proper plank form, causing a sag in the hips. I fixed this by piking slightly. I also learned to focus on pushing up and then over since a single push back to the center starting position caused more shoulder grind.\\n\\nOne tricky \"cost\" vs other pushups is a need to rotate the palms. The shifting weight already adds a more uncomfortable load to the heel of the hand that cannot be mitigated by using knuckles or finger tips. Padding can help with this but it should not add friction that impedes the palm rotation. I\\'ll be experimenting with some minor gear like gloves or paralletes.\\n\\nI\\'m also finding that a straight arm is more important than widening hand placement. Widening caused more failures without actually increasing intensity. Of course, there is a required minimum width somewhere outside the shoulders.\\n\\nWhile I highly recommend archer pushups over any other pushup variant, I\\'m still searching for how to complete that upper chest. Thankfully, there is another unilateral pushup variant called typewriter pushups. These feel harder than archers due to the persisted isometric load on the upper body. There is no rest between reps because there is no locking out.\\n\\nTypewriters seem even less documented than archers, so it\\'s unclear how far above the floor I should keep my chest. It needs to be somewhere between nipple scrape and lockout. I\\'m still new to typewriters but so far it seems that the ideal height is exactly midway. Any lower and my shoulders start to grind. The lateral motion seems to be a shallow rainbow. \\n\\nAfter only a handful of typewriters in each set I can feel the upper chest activation that I\\'ve been searching for. Time will tell if I see the visual balance. For now, the feeling alone is exciting enough. I don\\'t have any pics to share and hoping to see some moobs is a bit strange. Anyways, thank you for reading. I\\'d love to see more tips for bodyweight chest.\\n\\nTLDR: ring deeps and unilateral pushups., My handstand struggleHi guys, so as the title says, I have been struggling with my handstand progress.\\n\\n I started a few months back and at first the progress was coming really fast. \\n\\nThe thing is, I always only did chest to wall handstands, as I\\'m terrified of the kickup, which I\\'m aware is an issue. \\n\\nI\\'m probably an intermediate and strength Is definitely not an issue, however the balance is. At the beginning of my handstand training, I basically measured how far my hands are from the wall everytime and progressed that way.\\n\\n After a while I got to a point where my hands are at about one hand away from the wall. Since then I tried to improve my balance and get my feet away from the floor, and I did - a couple times for just seconds. \\n\\nSometimes I found the balance but immediately fell back because of fear of falling forward. Lately I also feel like I\\'m using way too much strength in the handstand and have zero balance and awareness. I can\\'t seem to get my alignment right either. \\n\\nI feel a lot of preassure on my shoulders and I\\'m not sure if that\\'s normal.\\n I always do my handstands on the wall for 45 seconds for 4sets, resting 2 minutes between.\\n I do them after my warm up and before my push workouts, which I do twice per week. \\n\\nShould I start practicing handstands more often? I never did because after push sessions I would always be sore and I feel like it would limit my handstands a lot. \\nAlso it seems like handstands are interrupting my hypertrophy workouts, which I mainly focus on.\\n Today I felt very weak after handstands and incline pike push ups were almost impossible with proper form. \\n\\nWhat is the fastest way to progress and get away from the wall? How many times per week should I train the handstand, since I\\'m focusing on hypertrophy training? I will appreciate any tips., What are some of the most useful supplements?, I want to plow through this so please give me help, Is this effective?, Is my routine adequate? Yoga/Music teacher\\'s adventures into BWF p.2Hello!  \\n\\\\[she/her/hers\\\\]  \\n\\n\\nSo, since my last post I\\'ve had a lot of progress with my routine. I even got some equipment because apparently I love strength training and even a little bit of weights. Feels very grounding + I can listen to lectures during working out. Plus, this girl can now scare catcallers away by just flexing, haha.\\n\\nI switched my routine twice (well, mostly rearranged what I do) and figured that yes, now that I have the equipment, I can do 3 days of RR a week + some changes due to my lifestyle.\\n\\nI wanted to hear some opinions on how my routine looks, if someone has the time and energy for it, please.\\n\\nBasically, it\\'s 3 RR pairs, after which I change the core work and add some skill and counter-work afterwards. The set to reps ration is the usual. I focus more on the breath, form and countering, control vs speed, no bursts. Additionally, I do points 1-7 w/ ankle and wrist weights (1 kg each) to remind myself about better form, control, and alignment instead of dropping everything.  \\n\\n\\n1. First Pair of RR\\n2. Second Pair of RR\\n3. Third Pair of RR\\n4. Core work (w/ stabilisation focus):  \\nParipurna Navasana 30-60 sec  \\nArdha Navasana 30-60 sec  \\n(these are static core holds in different shapes; can easily look them up)  \\nHanging leg raises\\n5. Arm raises w/ dumbbell:   \\nFrontal raises  \\nLateral raises  \\n(different rotation of the arm based on the week; one arm at a time w/ stabilisation; currently 6 kg)\\n6. Side forearm plank:   \\nArm raises (from waist to ceiling and overhead on exhale to lenghten, back on inhale)  \\nLeg raises (upper arm lengthened to the ceiling)\\n7. Extension work (Shalabhasana; I think you call them backbend arches or similar?):   \\nArm and head raises on inhale  \\nLeg raises on exhale  \\nDiagonal arm/leg extention and raise on inhale w/ head changing which side it faces.\\n8. Inversions (once each):   \\nHandstand 1-3 min  \\nHeadstand (supported and countered) 3 min w/ 2 variations, each 1 min  \\nBound supported shoulderstand for countering, 3 min\\n9. Other countering as needed and rest.\\n\\nThis takes me about two hours (a little more depending on the day) to complete, and I feel just wonderful and energized for the whole day. Points 5-9 really make it a relaxing time for me after a workout, and I\\'ve never felt as good in my yoga practice. Everything feels more complete and connected now.  \\n\\n\\nPeace and bless you, beautiful people   \\nxoxoxo, Pushup, Ab roller is amazingI creatively used my bar and plates as an ab roller today (because I\\'m bored and self isolating) and wow...my abs hurt so much right now, but in a good way.

I am debating whether i should move on to rto push ups or deep ring push ups. My current goal is chest hypertrophy and strength. I also want to put more emphasis on the upper portion of my chest because my lower chest is overdeveloped because of dips.\\n\\nI heard that the RTO push up stimulates the upper chest more because it has a similar movement pattern to a reverse grip bench press, which is supposedly a good upper chest exercise.

Maybe I\\'m being low-IQ about physics or something?\\n\\nAs best I can think of this, by leaning backwards your center-of-mass is no longer \"below\" your shoulders so where they go wouldn\\'t matter, and it does look like his navel is underneath the bar.\\n\\nSo in theory maybe you don\\'t need to grip the bar at all (ie just bend the first knuckle but not the rest?) to create anti-rotation?

Should I keep grinding them or change to something else?, I was never interested in body weight fitness until now. What do you recommend for someone in my shoes?I’m 6’4 ft tall, 24 years old, male. Think I’m about 225 Ib. I was 215 a couple moments ago but there’s no doubt in my mind I’ve gained weight. I need to check. \\n\\nBut anyways,  I’ve had a gym subscription for a while now and only used it in phases. Only during summer and winter break in school. But once school started I didn’t have time. Now I’ve graduated but good a new position at work and I’m completely full time now and sometimes I’ll work overtime. By time I’m out the gym will be absolutely packed and what should be an hour and half workout turns into 3 hours, plus COVID safety and whatnot. So I think it’s time I get out the gym and start doing some body weight exercising. I have a theater room in my garage. Screen and speakers are on side of the room and the couch on the opposite, with a good amount of space to do some damage in between. \\n\\nI want to do mostly body weight exercises, but I’m open to buying these things. Adjustable dumbbells, pull up bar, bands, and I guess that’s it? Maybe some plates since I asume most workouts will have core exercises that require weights. \\n\\nWith all that said, what workout do you recommend for me?

If not, then what do you suggest?I plan to only use calisthenics for upper body, as my goal is to attain the basic advanced exercises (Handstand Push Up, Planche Push Up, Front Lever Row, One Arm Pull Up and Muscles Ups). The reason for these moves are that they’ll stick with me and maintain strength to perform in any sports and life activities without reliance on external weight, and keeping equipment minimal since at most the luxury of rings is a nice addition.\\n\\nAs stated above, one of my goal is to keep my equipment minimal at home in my studio apartment. I have a pull up bar, rings, parallettes, and a 50 lb strongman sandbag on the way. I also have a pair of Olympic Dumbbell Handles, but don’t wanna try on them if I can just get the same strength gain benefits from Sandbags and Bodyweight.\\n\\nI’d like to add that I’ll be joining MMA, bjj, judo and other martial arts facilities. If I ever need further strength at a faster pace, then I’ll use their weights (assuming they have).\\n\\nAs for the sandbag move to strengthen the muscles that deadlift and squats hit would be sandbag shouldering.\\n\\nThis would mean my routine would be the Recommended Routine for upper body, and progressively moving up in weight with sandbag shouldering as my replacement for both the squat and deadlift.\\n\\nAgain, the goal is to keep the daily routine minimal, fast, yet productive in preventing and reducing injury, while developing the strength needed to handle 200 plus pound (and heavier to 300 lb) opponents, as well as handle daily tasks like kindly helping buddies move easily.\\n\\nI assume that if I can eventually shoulder a 250 to 300 lbs sandbag, for reps and sets, that I’ll have all the posterior chain and squat muscle strength needed to be equally or even stronger than those that use exclusively barbell, dumbbells or kettlebells as their primary strength methods.\\n\\nSo, what is your experience, knowledge and opinions on this approach of mine? I’m open to positive criticism with helpful advice and suggestions., Cross-Bench Dips vs Hanging DipsMy friend and I have been having a friendly competition on who is progressing faster and can do more weight (with good form and mid-range reps) on weighted dips. I have been doing weighted hanging dips and he has been doing weighted cross-bench dips, but I\\'m beginning to wonder the science behind which would be easier to overload and by what degree.\\n\\nFor example, is me adding +70 pounds to my hanging weighted dip the equivalent of him having a plate on his lap + 35 pound weighted vest on a cross-bench dip?

I am hoping to buy a variety and taste test.\\n\\nWhenever there is a gathering and there is a cheese board - I never know what to do or how to eat it/pair it.

Any ideas on the best plans for this? I’ve tried making up a meal plan/schedule but can never complete one fully where I have the calorie information per serving etc!!, I’m a real month how much money does it take you to feed your family?I feel like I see people say that they spend 200 a month to feed two people. I just don’t believe it. They must not be mentioning that they already have lots of meat in the freezer or that their pantry is already stocked or that they actually eat out 3-4 nights a week. \\n\\nWe definitely can trim our budget but it’s not uncommon for us to spend nearly $250 a week at Walmart (granted we have a family of 5 and 2 of them are in diapers). \\n\\nI just can’t fathom how people are claiming that they can feed a couple of people for so little., What do you eat when pregnantSo I\\'m pregnant (first trimester) and all I can find online is what not to eat.

Very earthy but light. \\n\\nIngredients - can of chickpeas, can of butter beans, creme freshe, bacon (or choice of substitute), (all sorts of alternates listed below. \\n\\n1.) Fry the bacon (sometimes I do this but with an egg as well, or without bacon completely)\\n\\n2.) Then add some butter to the pan to deglaze it abit. \\n\\n3.) Add chickpeas and butter beans in a little bit of butter with pepper and salt.\\n\\n4.) Cook till their golden and light brown. The shells will start to slip off the butter beans that’s a good sign.\\n\\n5.) Take them off the heat and into a bowl (it’s best to use a food processor apparently but i don’t have one) then mash with a fork and fold in the creme freshe! \\n\\n(interesting if you fry some chorizo instead of the bacon and you can cook the beans in the chorizo fat. But chorizo is abit expensive) \\n\\nmy flatmate cracks and egg into the actual mix ! but i can’t say it looked very appealing.

I just thought I’d share since I’ve never seen it before!, Gingerbread House?, Fruit Leather GuideFruit Leather is a great way to make fruit last longer and to get your non-fruit-loving people to eat it. It\\'s best made with a dehydrator, but you can also make it in your oven (I\\'ve also read about leaving it covered in the sun for several hours, but I\\'ll let you decide if that\\'s going to give you food poisoning or not).\\n\\nYou can use most fruits for this. The result will be a leather or crunchy chip, depending on how long you dry it for. I\\'ve tried a number of different fruits and the only one I will warn against is watermelon - tried it as a lark and it\\'s just crunchy sugar. I really like strawberries and blueberries mixed together.\\n\\nOur dehydrator is a round Cosori model and cost about $70. It\\'s about 3 years old now and we\\'ve made beef jerky, fruit Leather, and plenty of other dehydrated foods with it. It has paid for itself already. You will need solid tray inserts for it (ours came with 2, I found 3 more online).\\n\\nThe last batch I made used 1 package of fresh strawberries (use frozen if they\\'re cheaper) and 2 packs of blueberries. Rinse everything, toss any nasty ones, remove the leaves from the strawberries, dump them into a food processor or blender (processor works better) and puree them. Pour them onto the trays as thick as you can, spreading them evenly. If you go too thin, they stick to the tray and are hard to remove.\\n\\nCheck the recipe book for your dehydrator for time and temp. Ours was 8 hours at 165°F (70-75°C). If not fully dry, peel off, flip over on the tray, and give another hour or two., What would you recommend for simple 3 day meal?I’m trying to lose my belly on a budget.

Thanks, Better quiche recipeSome time ago, I posted this [Quiche recipe] which is still my favorite. \\n\\nBut thanks to Bigger Bolder Baking, I\\'ve discovered a better crust. I\\'ve also been making half the original recipe because now that I can make it quicker and easier, I make fresh rather than freezing portions. \\n\\nThis method takes about an hour, and most of that is cooking time. \\n\\nQuick Crust\\n\\nPour 1 cup of flour into a 6-inch baking pan. (I use a small Corning dish.)       \\nSprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt over the flour. Mix with a fork.     \\nAdd 3 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons water. Mix to make a stiff dough. Add up to 1 tablespoon water if needed.       \\nUsing fingers and knuckles, spread to cover the bottom of the pan, and about 1 inch up the sides. Make the crust as thin as possible. \\n\\nThis makes a very thin and crispy crust. It doesn\\'t get soggy like a regular crust can. \\n\\nMake half the quiche recipe. Pour into the crust. (No pre-baking needed.) Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes., Savory but healthy beverage suggestionHi I like beer as much as any Danish person :) \\nBut sometimes I want something non alcoholic.

NEURODRINE REVIEWS? What you need to Know About NE..., Easy ways to gain weight?Hi everyone\\nCurrently, I am recovering from anorexia. I am engaged with doctors and therapsits so that side of it is covered, so I\\'m safe to weight restore. Unfortunately, due to covid/problematic health services in my country, I don\\'t yet have a dietician to bother with my questions on nutrition .\\n\\nI\\'m wondering, what are some easy recipes/ideas to goan weight? I\\'m about 5 11 and around 48 kg, male, if any of that really matters. Please make them as healthy as possible, both for the obvious reason (I wanna be healthy when I\\'m better) and for the dumb reason(food scares me), LPT: it\\'s cheaper and healthier to make your own chocolate syrup.It\\'s pretty simple half cup of coco powder and your choice of sugar or sugar alternative 1 cup and 1/2 or 1 cup of water or low-fat milk, this makes about 12-16oz of syrup (or close to a bottle) but depending on what recipe you follow can be more or less. \\n\\nStir and microwave for 30 secs to melt sugar Crystals.\\n\\nI use stevia I buy with coupons but you can use whatever you like or buy cheaply. \\n\\nThis tastes much better than premade syrup, healthier (even if you use sugar it\\'s not as processed or you can make it sugar free or less sugar) \\n\\nAll in all cost of coco powder in bulk 5$ or 3$ regular size and sugar 1-2$ 4lbs (stevia cost around 1-4$ a lb but cheaper with coupons)\\n\\n5-7$ ish you can make 4-6 bottles of syrup depending on strength of coco you like + consistency (aka more or less water). Vs 3-4$ a bottle. \\n\\nI don\\'t add salt but most recipes do. I use the microwave cuz I\\'m lazy but of you want a more smooth consistency you could cook in a pan. \\n\\n\\nHere\\'s one recipe but there are many online with different ways still very cheap and tastier than premade imo \\n\\nYou can mess around with mixtures, measurements, some use vanilla optional. \\n\\nI make mine more on the dark chocolate side, normal chocolate syrup equal parts water and sugar and half Coco, Best Cheesy Broccoli Chicken Casserole.

I just figured, maybe someone in here are on a similar diet and can provide any tips.\\n\\nA bit more about me:\\n\\nI get easily nauseated from my meds and that means things in the fridge easily go bad, because I avoid eating at all. I also am not a good judge of when food has gone bad, so I keep second guessing myself and avoid buying meat at all. TV dinners are where it\\'s at for me, but that\\'s not healthy or cheap.\\n\\nI also have crohns, which in my case means my bowels  can suddenly decide \"No, I hate this food now, let\\'s punish her with pain and bodily fluids\", and I need to figure out what I dare to eat. I also hate hummus, beans, quina and lentils, which from what I gather are some of the best non-meat alternatives. Which is just lovely, I love my tastebuds.\\n\\nSo, I need to sit down with a calculator and try to figure out \"If I take two eggs, a handful of nuts and dry swallow some seeds, will that be enough?\", Bread with cheese and potatoes, Cherries 5 Benefits to Keep You Healthy and Good for Gout, Sleep, and M, Fatty Liver and Kidney Cyst, which seasonings can i still use?Hi, everyone!\\n\\nI\\'ve been intermittently fasting and avoiding carbs (especially sugars) and salt.

Can someone suggest vegan recipes for a protein shake and meals for three days a week for one day of weight training given that very few vegan proteins are available in my country?Non-native English speaker here. \\n\\nI am a 31 year old guy. I am 5 feet 4 and I weigh 56kg. I am out of home for work and with commute and office hours, its 70+ hours a week. I get out of bed at 7am, leave by 8am and return home at 10pm 5 days a week Sunday through Thursday. Friday is off and Saturday is training where I am out from 8am till 7pm. \\n\\nNow I am too depressed and I have too little time to exercise or eat healthily. I have recently decided to exercise on Friday for 1 hour: at least something is better than nothing. I got a workout routine from /r/EOOD. \\n\\nSo now, I need a plan to cover the nutrients. At the moment, the only thing possible would be to drink a shake on Fri, Sat, Sun and to eat something full of proteins and all on Fri, Sat, Sun on any particular meal time (either at breakfast, lunch or dinner but not in all three). The rest of the meals would have to be what I regularly eat. Obsessively meal planning and eating nutritiously for every meal every day of the week is just plain impossible at the moment. \\n\\nI also prefer not to eat meat and I would rather go for something that is vegan. Now the problem is, beans and peas give me gas. And most vegan protein substitutes like quinoa, tofu are either not available in Bangladesh or expensive. \\n\\nHere is a list from an online grocer from where I buy groceries:  \\n\\nBased on the list above, can someone suggest a \"nutrition plan\"? Simply a recipe for a protein shake that I can drink 3 days once in the evening and a few recipes for what I should eat for breakfast/lunch/dinner for 3 days of the week would be enough., Thinly sliced Brussels sprouts are amazing in stir-fries!

A lot of people post stuff like “I have $20 to last me until my first paycheck in 3 weeks, what should I eat?” I want to encourage you to look for food pantries in your area and use their services. \\n\\nAll this is from my experience in a mid-sized US city; things may work differently elsewhere, but most of the general ideas still apply. \\n\\n**tl;dr if you think you could possibly benefit from visiting a food bank, food pantry, or other free/reduced cost food organization, please do.** The people who work there want you to use it. You are not “taking away” food from people who “need it more”, because 1) everyone needs and deserves to eat and 2) often there is enough or too much food—the resources food banks are short on are more to do with insufficient funding, and more clients = more money allocated to them.  \\n\\nI have volunteered twice at a food pantry, but it is part of a larger organization I have volunteered at for years doing other food-related work (largely cooking and distributing hot meals), so I get to see how food donations come in and how we sort and allocate them. The organization I volunteer at serves a lot of needs in the community but one of their target populations is homeless youth, which is the demographic served by the hot meal program. The food pantry program serves a wider range of people (I started volunteering there because they need someone who speaks Spanish, and I’m unemployed now so the scheduling works out well). I also sometimes unload and sort donations from grocery stores and the city food bank, which in addition to providing food to individuals, also distributes it to other organizations throughout the city. \\n\\nSome things that I’ve noticed that might surprise people:\\n\\n* we often have too much food. By this I mean we get donated much more food than we have the capacity to cook, or people do not take all the food we serve. \\n\\n* On the rare occasion we do run out of food, it is more likely that we didn’t plan to cook enough, or had an unexpected influx of clients; I can’t think of a time that the hot meal program ran out of raw ingredients. (The food pantry and hot meal program share ingredients and distribute them as needed.) \\n\\n* The food pantry will often run out of high-demand items like milk, eggs, and culturally specific staple foods (like masa harina amongst the Hispanic clients) but even when this happens there is often an excess of other items that are perfectly good, just a little less familiar. The food pantry had two huge boxes of bok choy go nearly untouched this week; it got distributed to other sites so it’s not going to waste, but people were preferring to take fruits and veggies they knew how to cook and that their families would recognize. We’ve had the same cans of puréed pumpkin sitting on the self for weeks; there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s just less familiar to people so they gravitate towards other items. \\n\\n* There are nice, high-quality foods available, including a mix of fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable foods. We get lots of donations from Whole Foods and local stores in a similar price range, so there are many vegan and gluten-free options available as well as some really tasty baked goods and ready-to-eat meals. This time of year, grocery stores are going overboard on cookies for the holidays, so we have lots of those, to the point where volunteers are encouraged to take them home because we can’t give them away fast enough. \\n\\n* Speaking of which—volunteers and staff eat the same food as clients, because it is good food. Nothing is gross or bad—sometimes it is past the sell-by date but we have government guidelines as to how long different items stay safe to eat past their sell-by dates. For example, we keep milk for a week after its sell-by date and throw it out after. A lot of stuff has not even reached its sell-by rate but has some minor issue like the package being dented, it’s still perfectly good to eat.  \\n\\n* We are not judging you for using our services. If you have special needs like allergies or religious food restrictions, we will try to find something for you. Of course there are jerks working in every industry, but in general, if someone chooses to work or volunteer for a food pantry or other free food program, it is because they want to help, and believe everyone deserves enough to eat. \\n\\nIn general, American grocery stores have tons of perfectly good ingredients they can’t sell for whatever reason, and we usually get more than enough donated. Where nonprofit food programs have shortages is often in other areas—they can’t hire enough full time staff to keep food pantries open more than a few hours a week, or pay their staff enough to prevent burnout and high turnover. Or they can’t afford equipment, vehicles, real estate, etc. The food itself is unlikely to be what’s limiting them; they need money, and nonprofits get funding based on use. By using the food pantry, you are directly contributing to them being able to get more funds and provide more/better services. It’s not a direct 1:1 relationship between clients and funding but they will put things like “x number of clients used our services this year” in grant applications, and a higher number will lead to more money for them.  \\n\\nSo please—if you are in the position of having to feed yourself and/or others with very little money, while this sub can be a great resource on how to do that cheaply, please please please see what is available in your community and do not hesitate to make use of it! It is there for you. You can always volunteer or donate in the future when you’re doing better; for now, you need to eat and you deserve to eat well, and we want to help you. \\n\\nStart by searching “food bank” or “free food” plus your zip code or city. \\n\\n(And if you’re reading this as someone who is a little better off and wants to help, know that the best way to assist food banks is with cash donations. Volunteering is great too; I’m happy to answer questions about my experience if you are wondering!), Not wanting to always use GoogleHey There!

You only need a few ingredients...a little time-consuming but a great way to use up carrots...the Recipe makes about 50 dumplings for around $6.50.PIC: [\\n\\nHere\\'s what you need:\\n\\n* 1 ½ pounds carrots peeled and sliced into rounds ($2.69)\\n* 2 eggs ($.36)\\n* 16 ounces ricotta cheese ($2.89)\\n* 1¼ cup flour plus more if needed\\n* Salt and pepper\\n\\n# Instructions:\\n\\n#### Boil the carrots:\\n\\n* Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the carrots and cook until completely soft. You should be able to mash them easily against the side of the pot.\\n* Drain the carrots through a sieve and run cold water over them. You can put a few ice cubes on top of the carrots to speed up the process. Once the carrots are cool enough to handle, use a potato masher to mash them until completely smooth. Alternatively, you can use a food processor or ricer.\\n\\n#### Bring a pot of water to a boil:\\n\\n* Wipe out the pot used to cook the carrots and fill it with water again. Transfer to the stovetop and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil.\\n\\n#### Prepare the ricotta mixture:\\n\\n* In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Add the ricotta and whisk until incorporated with the eggs—season with salt and pepper.\\n\\n#### Finish the dumpling mixture:\\n\\n* Pour the ricotta over the carrots. Add the flour. Use a spoon or an electric hand-mixer to blend until combined. Do not overmix! The mixture should hold its shape but should not feel too doughy. It should still be a bit \\'wet\\' from the ricotta. If the mixture feels too loose, add more flour in 1 tablespoon increments.\\n\\n#### Taste the dumplings:\\n\\n* Once the water is boiling, drop a small pinch of the dumpling mixture into the pot. Once it floats, take it out and taste it. Adjust the seasonings in your ricotta dumpling mixture to taste.\\n\\n#### Boil the dumplings:\\n\\n* Use a teaspoon to scoop a spoonful of the mixture and run the edge of the spoon against the inside of the bowl to form a quenelle shape. These need not be perfect. With the dumpling mixture still on your spoon, place the spoon right into the boiling water and shake it to loosen the dumpling off the spoon.\\n* Continue until you have about 5–6 dumplings in the pot. Allow them to boil for 3–4 minutes until they float. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a large plate once cooked through. Alternatively, you can roll the mixture into balls between your hands and drop them right into the water. Again, be careful not to over-roll them, or the dumpling will be tough.\\n* Continue boiling the dumplings in batches until all the dumplings have been cooked.\\n\\nAt this point, you can serve with your favorite sauce (I did maple-sage) like a butter sauce or even simple tomato sauce. Any remaining cooked and un-sauced dumplings can be frozen. Arrange them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and place them in the freezer for 3 hours. Once they are frozen, transfer them to a gallon freezer bag. The dumplings will keep for 1 month in the freezer., HummusI recently got to know how easy it is to make hummus.

Over the years I\\'ve tried to make what can be a really boring dish more interesting, and I feel like I\\'ve topped myself on this Sunday. I came up with by buying some random things at the store, with North Africa in mind, particularly shakshuka. And I\\'m pretty sure I drew from all over the Med here, including Italy and Greece. So please, don\\'t come at me with \"tradition\". This is just a really cost effective, and delicious meal prep that, in my opinion, most novice cooks can make. I don\\'t measure, but I\\'ll give a list of ingredients I used with rough measurements. This style of cooking for me is very loose, so I apologize in advance. Also, I live in the US, so yes, I\\'ll be using freedom units since that\\'s how packages of food are labeled here. Also, this meal prep is great for vegetarians/vegans. I\\'m using some ingredients that would not be vegan, like anchovies and feta, but these obviously could be omitted and you\\'d still have something very delicious.\\n\\nBulk:\\n\\n-Large package of white sliced button mushrooms, 12 oz\\n\\n-Standard 1 lb bag of chickpeas, dried\\n\\n-1 bag of spinach, 6 oz\\n\\n-2 cans of Cento San Marzano tomatoes\\n\\nAromatics:\\n\\n-Olive oil\\n\\n-1 large onion\\n\\n-3 poblano peppers\\n\\n-2 serrano peppers\\n\\n-Half a head of garlic, minced\\n\\n-1 lemon\\n\\nSpice:\\n\\n-3ish tablespoons of smoked paprika (I wanted to use harissa, but they didn\\'t have any at the store)\\n\\n-1 tablespoon caraway seeds\\n\\n-1 tablespoon cumin\\n\\n-1 teaspoon ground coriander\\n\\n-Red pepper flakes (I really like spice so I used a few tablespoons worth, most people I would imagine would put in maybe just one)\\n\\n-3 bay leaves\\n\\nUmami boosters:\\n\\n-3 anchovies\\n\\n-Tomato paste\\n\\nLiquid:\\n\\n-About a half bottle of white wine\\n\\n-Water to rinse out cans\\n\\nGarnish:\\n\\n-Feta\\n\\n-Basil\\n\\nSo this is a mixture of stuff I bought today, and things I had in the pantry already. I think I spent maybe 15 bucks (or maybe less) at the store today, and this makes at least eight servings, if not more. And honestly, you could omit the feta to cut out the cost a bit. Easily the most expensive thing I got today at the store, but it was worth it. So I\\'ll go over my procedure.\\n\\nBean soaking:\\n\\nI soaked the chickpeas overnight in cool tap water with like 3 pinches of kosher salt. I don\\'t think you necessarily have to do this step, but beans/chickpeas cook quicker if they\\'re soaked, and apparently soaking with salt improves texture according to people on the internet I\\'ve read/heard, while also seasoning the chickpea. If you didn\\'t plan ahead, you\\'ll probably just need to cook the chickpeas longer. Make sure you put in more water than you think is necessary. I\\'m always amazed to how big beans and chickpeas get when soaking, and you don\\'t want them peeking out above the water overnight.\\n\\nAromatic base:\\n\\nI really like mushrooms in all of my stews/braises/bean prep for added meatiness and texture. I also like them because I kind of use them like a cured pork product to start the base of a sauce, similar to frying some pancetta to start a ragu. But don\\'t feel like you need to do this if you don\\'t like mushrooms. I start by throwing the mushrooms in my enameled dutch oven with some water on medium heat, and throw in a pinch of salt. The goal here is to draw out as much water as possible and then to evaporate the water. Once the water is mostly gone (this will take a bit, maybe like 10 minutes for me), put in enough olive oil to allow the mushrooms to brown (ghee would be good here too). I\\'m still using medium heat, and I give enough time to brown without touching. During this whole process is when I\\'m cutting my onions, peppers, garlic, and getting the rest of my stuff ready. Once the browning smell becomes apparent (took me around 5-7 minutes), move mushrooms around and try and flip as many as possible. Brown a little bit more, then remove. I put the mushrooms in a bowl, covered with a plate and stuck in the fridge. In leftover fat and fond, throw in chopped up onions and peppers with a pinch of salt to draw out water. Still medium heat. Scrape bottom with a wooden spoon to deglaze fond so it doesn\\'t burn. Allow vegetables to sweat out moisture, took about 10 minutes for me.\\n\\nUmami boosting and spice frying:\\n\\nOnce the vegetables have sweated, I like to make a well in the center by moving the vegetables to the edges, and add in oil to coat that space. Then in separate spots in that well I like to add in this order: anchovies, spices, tomatoes paste, garlic. Anchovies I like to give 4 minutes frying, spices 3 minutes, tomatoes paste 2 minutes, garlic 1 minutes; so each minute I\\'m adding the next thing. The reason I do it in this order is because now we\\'re at risk of burning if care isn\\'t being used. The spices are fat soluble, but given the powdered nature, it could get hairy if overdone. The tomato paste needs to cook out to get rid of the metallic taste of the tube, but it\\'s full of sugar and sugar can burn very fast. And fine garlic goes from golden and nice to black and burned in like 10 seconds. Anchovies I\\'ve never really had an issue with, but I like to give them a little frying before the liquid comes. Also, don\\'t be afraid of anchovies. It\\'s not essential, but it really kicks up the savoryness of food. I think I heard Chef John call anchovies Italian msg, and I totally agree. It will not make your food taste fishy, I promise. Also, the spices I fried were the paprika, cumin, coriander, and caraway.\\n\\nAfter frying (when the garlic is fragrant), I like to stir everything around. Probably not necessary, but I just like to do it.\\n\\nLiquid:\\n\\nI deglazed with the rest of a bottle of white wine I had leftover (around 350 mL). I always have Woodbridge Pinot Grigio for my all purpose cooking wine. It sucks as a drinking wine, but perfect for cooking. I\\'ve heard that you don\\'t want to cook with wine you wouldn\\'t drink, but I\\'m calling bullshit. I\\'m not going to notice the nuisances from wine in food. However, if you don\\'t want to use wine, any stock would work. Veggie stock for vegans. Animal stock if you want. Once that\\'s in, scrape any fond up from the vegetables. Then add the tomatoes. Rinse out cans to get all of the tomato water out of the can and add. This is a lot of liquid, but I tend to cook things like this for a long time and it will reduce. Then while bringing to a boil, I add bay leaves and red pepper flakes. These things steep like tea, and are perfect for adding during the liquid phase. Maybe the flakes could be fried, but I never do.\\n\\nSimmer and blend:\\n\\nBring to a boil on high, then reduce to simmer. On my 1-9 stovetop, I find that 3 is perfect for simmering. Every stovetop is different though. Now I just like to have this chilling on the stove for hours. I started at 10 this morning, and simmered until 6:30. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn\\'t dry out. Add water when necessary. Eventually everything in that pot is going to fall apart. Some people would strain the solids out, but I like to take them to my advantage. So instead of straining and thickening the liquid later, I just get an immersion blender and blend until smooth. You get a really nice smooth, thick sauce and retain all of the fiber, which is good for you. Totally not necessary though. I usually do this like an hour before I plan to eat. Remove bay leaves before you blend.\\n\\nCook chickpeas:\\n\\nI drain the chickpeas with a colander, and then put in a pot and cover with fresh water. Bring to boil, then cook for 30 minutes while skimming off the foam that rises. After the timer goes off, I test a chickpea. If it\\'s creamy, and maybe even a little overdone, it\\'s perfect. Starches harden when they cool, so overshooting the mark usually gets me the perfect texture at eating temperature. If it\\'s not done after 30 minutes, then I check in 3 minute increments. Really shouldn\\'t take more than 45 minutes, but test just to make sure. If you didn\\'t soak your beans, an hour is probably minimum, but maybe test after 50 minutes. \\n\\nFinishing touches:\\n\\nOnce everything is ready, I add the chickpeas to the sauce along with the mushrooms from the fridge. Ideally the sauce is drier than I want it right now, so I can adjust the liquid level at the end. During this time, I also added an entire bag of spinach to up the nutrition. It\\'s going to look like way too much at first, but keep faith and keep stirring the spinach in, and it\\'ll melt into the sauce. Once everything is in, zest the lemon, and add half of the lemon juice. Taste and assess the acid level. If it needs more, add the other half of the lemon juice. Add water to desired sauce thickness. Now is the time for salinity assessment. Taste and adjust for salt until you like it. I usually find that with big pots of sauces/stews/beans, they need A LOT of salt. I start with two four finger pinches of kosher, then keep adjusting. However, I think my salt tolerance is high, so use your own discretion.\\n\\nPlate and garnish: \\n\\nTo serve, I had some leftover basmati rice that I just threw in the microwave for a minute. Then I spooned some of the chickpeas and sauce in a bowl on top of the rice. Then I topped with a few leaves of basil that I rolled up did a chiffonade on. I chose basil because it\\'s my favorite herb, but I think a multitude of herbs would be nice. Cilantro, mint, parsley, maybe tarragon could all work here. I topped with some feta that I crumbled off the block. I used Mevgal, and it\\'s fucking delicious. I\\'m used to cheaper feta that tends to be dry. But if you can buck up the cash, it\\'s worth getting the fancy cheese. \\n\\nPicture:\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not really a photographer, but I wanted to show how it looked. It was a very satisfying dinner, and will be a for a while.\\n\\nThat\\'s it. I don\\'t expect anyone to make this the same exact way that I did. But if this give others idea of what they\\'d like to do with a bean/chickpeas meal prep, then I\\'ll be happy. I love food like this, especially during the winter months since I feel warmed up while eating it. Hope everyone reading has a pleasant end of the year, and well wish to you and yours., Stock/broth tastes watery?So I’ve been saving up chicken bones and scraps and vegetable scraps to make some good stock/broth.

For me, it\\'s less about feeling full, and needing something to soak up or eat to compliment others parts of the meal, such as your meat, saucy vegetables etc.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ve started experimenting with different ways to create small little somethings, similar to rice, but not rice. Of course you have your standard barley, wheat, quinoa, grits, couscous, grits, etc.\\n\\nBut one of my favorite things to do is create my own. Take a head of cauliflower or broccoli, and throw it in the food processor or blender. Whip it up, and now you have texturally, rice. But flavor-wise, broccoli or cauliflower, effectively adding more vegetables to your diet. \\n\\nCan do the same with a potato, throw it in a masher, and you get similar results. Barley is great as well, and freekah. Just having something texturally similar to rice will help you feel more full. Try it with eggplant as well. I find this trick works if the vegetables are dry and texturally sound or hard. \\n\\nMaybe you\\'re like me, and you enjoy noodles! Maybe even more so then rice! Gasps. Then the world of possibilitys is endless.\\n\\nTake carrots, and use a vegetable peeler to grate them. Save the skins for soup. But use the inside for long, spaghetti, carrot noodles. Fry them in butter. Yum. \\n\\nCan do the same for zucchini, so you have a color of explosion. That\\'s literally where the name zoodles come from.\\n\\nTake eggplant, bell peppers, cut them in noodle like shapes and fry. They\\'ll become pliable and noodle like.\\n\\nMy favorite is red cabbage or regular green cabbage. Super cheap and a head can last a long time in freezer. If you cut the cabbage in strips, you can use them as noodles. Same for bean sprouts.\\n\\nThese rice and noodles work best in stir fries, or lightly fried in butter. Cook them too long, and it\\'ll act like a vegetable of course. Don\\'t put them in soup expecting them to soak up extra liquid. They\\'re rice and noodle alternatives.\\n\\nHappy eating!, One of my go-to depression meals: sautéed onions and zucchini with 3 ounces each of rice and lean ground beef, Festive Pumpkin Beet Polenta - Great for an Appetizer, FYI, Ibotta has a ton of plant based food offers right now.Impossible meat, pizzas, Jimmy Dean, etc. definitely worth looking into if you’re trying to eat plant based right now., How to make a famous upside down banana bread with 1 egg and without oven., If you had an unlimited amount of time, what would you make for breakfast?If you had an unlimited amount of time, what would you make for breakfast?\\n\\nI am looking for some new “breakfast”inspiration and I’m wondering what your personal go to’s would be. ☺️, What do you make when you\\'re hungry, but you haven\\'t got groceries?So, I mean that you have almost nothing at Home and still are hungry.

They\\'re delicious, nutritious and super easy to have around (unlike having to thaw and prepare chicken or some other meat.)\\n\\nI guess my question is just does anyone else cook eggs for dinner, if so what do you make? I\\'m tired of simply making a scrambled egg w/ bell peppers &amp; Parmesan cheese and feel like I should do something different with my eggs for dinner lol, !!, Easy meals for the entire dayAside from eating cheap and healthy I also like to eat with minimal effort and cleanup. I only cook with a frying pan. I get enough variation through alternating lunch and dinner options, and also eating out. Here is my usual day - \\n\\nBreakfast - Oatmeal: 1/3 cup quick cooking oats, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup water... combine and microwave for 1:30. Add a drizzle of maple syrup and a spoon of brown sugar and stir. Side options include hardboiled eggs and fruit. \\n\\nMorning Snack - Juice Shake: Add baby spinach and pre-packaged frozen fruit to a blender, 50:50 ratio and fill about 2/3rd full. Then fill with OJ and water, using a little bit more OJ than water. Keeps sugar down and saves on OJ.\\n\\nLunch - Bread and cheese: You might spend a little more on higher quality breads and cheeses from the deli, still cheaper than lunch meat which isn\\'t that healthy anyways. You don\\'t need meat for every meal. But yeah I just spread/put cheese on bread and dunk it in olive oil. Can try other spreads too like hummus or olive tapenade. lots of variation possible here.\\n\\nAfternoon snack - Random: Apples, pistachios, grapes, protein shake. Call it a wild card.\\n\\nDinner - I Mainly make two dinners which I alternate between, Beef burritos and chicken shawarma. Both using tortillas and can be cooked in one pan. I also get leftovers for the next day. \\n\\nFor the beef burritos: Brown ground beef (90/10+ if you don\\'t want to drain) in pan on medium heat, then run just enough water to be able to stir in seasoning (packets always say to add too much imo), add taco seasoning packet and a spoon of corn starch, keep stirring as you slowly turn down heat over about 5 minutes and give it a taste test. From here I heat the tortilla, add cooked beef, mexican blended cheese, and taco bell sauce but toppings are up to you. I figure I get enough nutrition earlier in the day so I usually just keep it simple.\\n\\nFor the chicken shawarma: I buy chicken breast in bulk and then cut it up into bite sized pieces. Then add about 2-3 spoons of premade shawarma marinade (I like the one from Whole Foods, go there just for that) into some ziploc bags. After that add chicken. close the bags and mix marinade with chicken in bag by mushing it around with your hands. Freeze and thaw as needed. Once thawed remix the bag again and let it sit at room temp for 30 minutes before cooking. Add a dash of cooking oil (don\\'t use olive) to a pan and turn the heat to HIGH (notch or two below max). Add the chicken to the pan and stir/flip frequently. Add whatever seasoning, I use a premix like Johnny\\'s. It should get a nice blackening/seer in a few minutes, once it does turn the heat down just a notch or two and cook for another few minutes. Check that there is no pink. Heat some tortillas and add Hummus and baba ghanoush. Then add cooked chicken. Then add cut up spicy pickles. \\n\\nI hope this gave you some ideas.

I\\'ve managed to do this by mixing a lot of blackened meats into my diet. Blackening uses extremely high heat and is generally pretty quick, while using only enough oil (preferably avocado) to keep the protein from sticking. The process was originally meant for fish, but can be used on chicken, shrimp, or even pork. I recommend Using Paul Prudhomme\\'s Redfish Magic, as far as I know it was actually Prudhomme who invented the blackening process and this stuff is better than the options put out by other companies. I highly recommend this underrated cooking method to anyone looking to add a lot of flavor to their food without adding excess calories. \\n\\nOne caveat: make sure you have a functional vent hood if trying to cook a lot at one time.

Allow to soften (10-15 minutes). \\n- Add the potato, beans, tomato and veggie stock. Simmer for 20 minutes (or until the potato is soft, if you’re using potatoes). You want the flavour in the tomato to become less acidic.\\n- Add pasta and keep on the heat until just before the pasta takes on the texture you like. Remove from the heat and, if you’re fussy, decant into another container to prevent the pasta overcooking. \\n- Season with salt and pepper. \\n\\nNotes\\n- Exclude the bacon and use egg free pasta for a vegan recipe.\\n- Play around with the amount of aromatics (I often use extra oregano). \\n- Keep the potato and pasta out for something more low calorie. \\n- Add chickpeas as a sub for the beans (or use whatever bean you like). Or use a combo. \\n- Use fresh tomatoes as a cheaper option, but you may need to add a little extra stock there. \\n- Add spinach or kale at the end for greens. \\n- Watch out that you don’t overdo the pasta, it can wind absorbing all the soup juice. \\n- Especially if you don’t use pasta, serve with warm toast., The recipe suggests \"Put the ginger, garlic and four tomatoes into a food processor and blitz until smooth.

It\\'s helped curb my dessert cravings. Here it is:\\n\\n-A full bowl of Greek yoghurt \\n\\n-2 handfuls of almonds, crushed. I prefer raw almonds because they\\'re more nutritious (And also kind of sweet)\\n\\n-Any kind of sweet topping you want. Banana, granola, a little bit of caramel sauce, anything goes. Personally, I don\\'t like anything mushy in this so I avoid fruits and only add caramel sauce or some granola. \\n\\n-To make the yoghurt thicker, I mix it with a tbsp of corn starch, and freeze it for 15 minutes (You could freeze it for more but I\\'m impatient). Freezing is optional.\\n\\nDone! I was so skeptical of eating greek yoghurt as a dessert but it\\'s so delicious this way.

It honestly just tastes like sweet, earthy beets. Does anyone have a good recipe? And tips on how to cook them to be eaten cold?, Help me figure out the cheapest chicken chunks possible!I don\\'t usually like making whole freezer meals ahead of time, but I do like preparing and freezing ingredients. It allows me to feel spontaneous and opens up lots of options while still saving me time. I have successfully done this with large amounts of rice, dry beans, bacon bits, bread, chicken stock, pan-fried chicken chunks, etc. (I have been planning to pre-dice and freeze onions, and even pre-caramelize some and freeze them in ice cube trays).\\n\\nNow I am looking to make my chicken chunks from chicken leg quarters (the cheapest protein source after dried beans in my area, beating out protein powder, canned beans, eggs, and milk!). I want the chunks to have the browning and crispiness from pan frying, I don\\'t want them to end up overcooked, and I don\\'t want to debone them before starting (I would then consider my time more valuable than the difference in the chicken price and just buy boneless meat). So my thought is to parbake the chicken in the oven until I can pull the chicken off the bone with my hands, then cut into chunks and finish in the frying pan. Does anyone know at about what internal temperature I can expect the chicken to somewhat willingly separate from the bone? (If not, I\\'ll probably just do it trial and error).

I couldn\\'t bear the thought of more lasagna so I started reading and I found out about *riso al forno*. There aren\\'t a TON of recipes out there for it and a lot of them are in Italian, but I decided to give it a go. I don\\'t think this is meant to have the super creamy consistency of risotto (I could be wrong; if anyone has any info on this dish, I\\'d love to be corrected!)\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have arborio rice, I think you could still make something similar, just use 6 cups of cooked short-grain rice. \\n\\nThe basic premise is you parboil arborio rice and toss it with oil and/or parmesan cheese. One recipe also suggested letting the rice cool down *completely* and then tossing it with 2 whisked eggs which is a great alternative to the cheese.\\n\\nThen you basically layer it in a casserole dish... rice, homemade sauce, cheese, and then rice, sauce, cheese, and then bake for 25–30 minutes or until the rice is tender. You can use a mix of parmesan, provolone, or mozzarella or I bet you could even skip the cheese completely if you wanted to. \\n\\nIt\\'s basically like lasagna but with rice. I thought it turned out really good so I thought I\\'d share the recipe here.\\n\\nI made a homemade meat sauce, but feel free to disregard that and just use \\\\~6 cups of your favorite sauce. Marinara or a meat sauce would both be great in this.\\n\\nRecipes I\\'ve seen online suggest that you could add cured meat to this or a layer of thinly sliced hardboiled eggs too.\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n* 2 cups arborio rice\\n* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\\n* 1 cup shredded parmesan cheese divided (or omit, it\\'s not totally necessary)\\n* 1 teaspoon neutral oil\\n* 2 pounds ground meat of choice (beef, sausage, pork, turkey, or a mix)\\n* 2 tablespoons butter plus more for greasing the casserole dish\\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\\n* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced\\n* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more to taste\\n* ½ teaspoon dry thyme\\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\\n* 3 15-ounce cans crushed tomatoes\\n* 1 teaspoon sugar optional\\n* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese divided\\n* Salt and pepper to taste\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n#### Parboil the arborio rice:\\n\\n* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under very cold water. Once the rice is cool to the touch, transfer it to a large bowl with 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and toss to coat. Set aside.\\n\\n#### Brown the meat:\\n\\n* Add 1 teaspoon neutral oil to the second large pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the meat and use a wooden spoon to break them up as they cook—season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for 12–15 minutes until the meat browns and is mostly cooked through. Transfer to a bowl.\\n\\n#### Cook the sauce aromatics:\\n\\n* Melt the butter into the pot used to brown the meat. Once bubbly, add the onion and cook for 6–8 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic, crushed red pepper, and thyme and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\\n\\n#### Simmer the sauce:\\n\\n* Add the tomato paste and mash it into the aromatics. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color. Add the canned tomatoes and stir to incorporate. Add the sugar, if you like. Add the cooked meat to the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking.\\n\\n#### Assemble the rice:\\n\\n* Preheat oven to 350ºF.\\n* Grease a 12×8 baking dish with butter.\\n* Add half of the parboiled arborio rice to the dish and use the back of your spoon to flatten it into an even layer. Next, ladle over half the sauce and spoon it into an even layer over the rice. Next, add half the shredded mozzarella cheese and half of the remaining grated parmesan (if using). Add the remaining rice and then the sauce. Finish the casserole with the remaining mozzarella and remaining parmesan cheese.\\n\\n#### Bake the rice:\\n\\n* Transfer to the preheated oven for 25–35 minutes. Check the rice at 25 minutes and continue baking until tender.\\n\\n#### Broil the rice (optional):\\n\\n* Once the rice is tender, drizzle with 1–2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil and transfer to the broiler for 1–2 minutes until the cheese bubbles and turns deep golden brown.\\n\\n#### To serve:\\n\\n* Allow the riso al forno to set out at room temperature for 5–10 minutes.

But are there specific coffee habits that can help us lose weight?\\n\\nIt\\'s safe to say that for some of us, coffee may be the one thing getting us through our busiest days of the week. And, for the most part, those daily cups can actually benefit our health as long as they\\'re consumed in moderate amounts.\\n\\nCaffeine is found in many beverages, including coffee, tea, energy drinks and colas, and in products containing cocoa or chocolate. It\\'s also found in medications and dietary supplements, including supplements aimed at weight loss.\\n\\nAlthough research about the connection between caffeine and weight isn\\'t definitive, there are a few theories about how caffeine might affect weight, including:\\n\\nAppetite suppression. Caffeine may reduce feelings of hunger and your desire to eat for a brief time.\\n\\nCalorie burning. Caffeine appears to increase energy use even when you\\'re at rest. It stimulates thermogenesis — one way your body generates heat and energy from digesting food.\\n\\nSome studies looking at caffeine and weight were poor quality or done in animals, making the results questionable or hard to generalize to humans. Some studies found that decaffeinated coffee may contribute to modest weight loss, suggesting that substances or factors besides caffeine may play a role in weight loss.\\n\\nThe bottom line: Be cautious about using caffeine products to help with weight loss. When used in moderation (400 milligrams or less) by healthy adults, caffeine is generally safe. But too much caffeine might cause nervousness, insomnia, nausea, increased blood pressure and other problems.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that some caffeinated beverages, such as specialty coffees or teas, are high in calories and fat. Just adding milk and sugar to coffee or tea could set back your weight loss efforts, especially if you drink multiple cups a day. Instead of losing weight, you might actually gain weight if you drink too many of these higher calorie drinks.\\n\\nWith. to learn which coffee habits they believe can help you lose weight and stick to your health goals.

(so maybe mixed/wild rice instead of white, sweet potatoes instead of regular, that kind of thing) another thing I need to watch out for is nutrients.

Eating this much bird ensures we have bones and carcasses lying around. People usually skip that part, but it\\'s my favorite. The bones have so much flavor. Especially if they\\'re roasted or cooked. Makes for an amazing bone broth soup if you boil it long enough, or stock for other items on your holiday list. Or one of my favorite ways to enjoy the large parts of bones with little meat, is to boil them with rice, in a porridge like fashion called congee or jook.   \\n\\n\\nA cup of rice and 8-9 cups of water will yield you almost 5-6 portions and bowls of congee. It\\'s a simple, but hearty rice porridge. Once the rice starts boiling for about 10 or so minutes in, throw in all your bones and carcasses. The roasted-ness, as well as the bones, would impart all their flavor into the rice congee, and the meat will separate from the bones, falling into the congee. \\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s filling, warm, and low calories. Throw a fried egg on top, stir fry, or any little odds and ends from the fridge. I typically start with a blank canvas, but end up with a flavorful bowl of porridge.   \\n\\n\\nI typically have the congee and serve the items family-style, so I can appreciate each individual item, as opposed to having a mixed medley, although that\\'s your preference. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nGood luck., What\\'s your liquid of choice for smoothie base?I like to use coconut water but it\\'s expensive and expires quickly once opened.

My entire mother\\'s side of the family is riddled with heart disease. Her father died of it in his early 50s. She\\'s been on heart meds since she was in her early 40s. It\\'s sort of the family curse.\\n\\nBut it\\'s hit me pretty young, and I want to take it seriously and really adjust my diet to try and be as healthy as possible. I already know to stay away from saturated fats and cholesterol, and to find good sources of omega-3 fatty acids like fatty fish.\\n\\nHit me with your best heart healthy foods and recipes, please!, Great Occasion Great Offers Textbooks With Deep Discount You won\\'t Find Anywhere, Join the Crypto Bull Society (CBS) Discord Server!, easy, healthy meals for depressive episodes?So I (21f) work about 30 hrs a week, am a full-time student, and struggle with depression and OCD. I often go through phases where my depression is so bad that I just feel completely exhausted and worn down. I have a partner but he works more hrs than I do and does a large chunk of the housework, so I make up for it by being responsible for meals. He isn\\'t much for cooking anyways, and steers towards fast food like I do. Unfortunately my depression creates this cycle where I\\'m too exhausted to make nutritious meals, and then eat fast food which makes me more exhausted/depressed.\\n\\nI could really use some help with simple, healthy snacks and meals that are low-effort. No dietary restrictions. Thank you so much., my manic manifesto on why everyone should eat currythis might have a kind of insane, frenzied energy to it, because somehow it took me years to realize that curry is literally *perfect* for everyone(mostly), and i desperately need to tell the world why this is in excruciating detail. on the way, you will learn a bit about me, and i about you. take my hand. let us begin.  \\n\\n\\nit would be most appropriate to start with the sub\\'s two main points-- cheap and healthy. curry passes both with flying colors(and flavors!), though the health bit can be tricky. i found many different flavors at the store, for around $3-5. for me personally, this on rice can last me a couple days, eating mostly that, but lmao, i am a 117lb, 5\\'5 underweight guy with no appetite, so make of that what you will. however, it does mean curry is flexible like that. if you wanna sacrifice some flavor, you can spread it a bit thinner and make it last. as for health, the bottom line is that [good curry is quite healthy, but cheap/bad curry is not.]( homemade curry is healthiest of all, but although that shit slaps ass, it is not something i\\'d recommend doing unless you have time, effort, and willingness to hunt down a bunch of spices. so, we are talking about jars or packets of curry here. microwave or stove, dump it on rice, done. a day of food right there.  \\na meal for me needs to be easy, because i have severe illnesses that make me very tired and depressed. i eat very little, and have a hard time getting myself to eat, so i\\'d say the food should be filling as well as healthy, and simple to prepare. less effort, less fatigue, more food, better health!! i had a field day at meijer in the world foods section, staring at all the flavors for ages and finally just grabbing 3 packets and a jar for butter chicken curry mmmm. that\\'s $12.46, man. i was so excited, because maybe this meant i wouldn\\'t be so hungry and weak. it was making me a bit emotional and excited lol.\\n\\nanother amazing thing about curry is the flavor. it is spicy, but many are mild and quite alright. if you have GI issues though, you might have trouble. not sure how spices affect that. there are so many interesting flavors and textures, and it\\'s so easy to just grab half a dozen packets for super cheap and live off of that for the week, easy. all the flavor makes eating easier if you have a lack of appetite, too! and if you get tired of one, there are heaps of others. it\\'s perfect for me.\\n\\nthat brings me to my last point. curry isn\\'t just an exciting new idea to help my health, it\\'s awesome for anyone. it\\'s not just good for sick people, it\\'s for busy people, or students, anyone strapped for cash, or even if you\\'re just damn lazy and hate making food. it\\'s also cool, because if you like cheaper curry, you\\'ll probably love the really good shit. both taste good though, and are generally healthy, which is so cool to me. if you really get into it, you can eat premade stuff when you\\'re low on time/energy, and have fun with the really [neat and interesting recipes]( when you have an evening.  \\n\\n\\ni have no closing statement. go eat curry, High calorie healthy mealsStudent here on a student budget about to start bulking and was looking for some cheap healthy high calorie meal ideas, many thanks in advance, IF YOU WANT TO BE HEALTHY BUY THIS COOKBOOK AND TRY THESE TASTY MEALS!, 30-Minute Weekday Bean StewI wanted to share a quick, clean and vegan weekday bean recipe that I have adapted from [Budget Bytes\\'s Quickie Black Eyed Peas and Greens]( It takes a bit less than 30 minutes and has little prep time. \\n\\nCooking beans from dry would be cheaper and more environmentally friendly but does require planning the day before or using an Instant Pot. This recipe uses canned beans so you can whip it up. \\n\\nThis makes 5 servings. \\n\\n**Ingredients** \\n\\n* 1 yellow onion \\n* 3 cloves garlic \\n* 3 Tbsp olive oil \\n* 1 large bell pepper (red or green) \\n* 1 large stalk of celery \\n* 3 15oz. cans black eyed peas or pinto beans or romano beans - all are tasty, feel free to grab whichever is cheapest. \\n* 1 tsp dried oregano \\n* 1 tsp smoked paprika \\n* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper \\n* 1 bay leaf \\n* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper \\n* 2 tsp Better than Bouillon (or bouillon)  \\n* 2 cups water\\n* 1 bunch of collard greens or kale \\n* Hot sauce (to taste - I used some Carolina Reaper hot sauce I had around) \\n* Rice. I used 1 cup of dry [parboiled brown rice]( or you can use white rice, if you\\'re wanting to keep it under 30 minutes. Using normal brown rice will take about 40 mins. \\n\\n**Directions** \\n\\n1. Add olive oil to a large pot. While it is warming, chop onion, bell pepper, and celery. Dice garlic. \\n2. Once oil is warm, add chopped onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic. Cook until onion is soft and translucent.  \\n3.  Drain beans or peas and add them to the pot with oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, pepper, bay leaf, water, and Better than Bouillon.  \\n4. Begin cooking rice. I use a 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water ratio for parboiled brown rice. \\n5. Put lid on pot, turn heat up until it reaches a boil. While waiting for the beans to boil, rinse your greens and tear them off the stems. \\n6. Once the beans are boiling, turn heat down to medium low. Add greens. You don\\'t need to mix the greens in; they will steam on top. Simmer for 15 minutes. \\n7. After the beans have simmered for 15 minutes, take lid off pot and mush some beans against the side of the pot to thicken the broth. Add salt if necessary - I did not need to add any, personally. Remove bay leaf. I added hot sauce post-serving so that it kept a good bite but you could also add hot sauce at this time.\\n8. Serve over rice. \\n\\nThis recipe is great for meal prep - it freezes well or keeps well in the fridge for a few days., Will you please have anal sex with a christian, because I love Jesus, and God, and mother mary!, Protein PancakesI recently developed this recipe after some experimentation. The recipe makes two cakes, but can easily be scaled. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDry ingredients:\\n\\n· ¼ c flour\\n\\n· ½ tsp baking powder\\n\\n· 1 scoop (25g protein) protein powder\\n\\n· Pinch salt\\n\\n· 1 tsp granulated sweetener\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWet ingredients:\\n\\n· 2/3 c water, roughly\\n\\n· 2 tsp oil\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMix the dry ingredients together, add wet, mix until most lumps are gone. After that you’re just making pancakes. \\n\\nI omitted egg from the recipe because I found protein powder works as a good binding agent. The protein powder I used (Truetein) also contained egg white protein. I am not sure how the recipe tastes with other powders, but with Truetein it is a treat.\\n\\nNote that this much protein powder will make the pancakes a little gummy. They are still delicious, but a more traditional pancake can be made by halving the amount of protein powder (or my preferred method, doubling the other ingredients).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMacros: \\n\\n· Calories: 285\\n\\n· Protein: 27g\\n\\n· Carbs: 26g\\n\\n· Fat: 8g, Are you stuck in a rut with your weight loss? Here are some possible explanations., Food banks for those not strugglingHi, I recently had an interesting idea when I came across the statistic that foodbanks can get $5 worth of value from a $1 donation. I\\'m not sure how true that is, but it made me think. I can afford groceries, definitely- I\\'m not affluent but I\\'m fine. However, I\\'m wondering if couldn\\'t take the opportunity to use the food bank, calculate it\\'s value at a regular store and pay maybe 1/2 to 2/3 the value back to the food bank as a donation.  \\n\\n\\nBasically I\\'d be able to save money on groceries and donate part of that excess back to the foodbank- to me it seems like a win/win, but I need to know that I\\'m not overlooking something here. Thanks for any answers!, Fast &amp; easy meal ideas that require little to no clean up?I\\'m trying to eat out less for lunch to save some money...  What lunch ideas do you have that are easy to make and don\\'t require a lot of clean up?, Cheap and Healthy Perfected \\n\\nCooking or not cooking is a state of mind.\\n\\nA state of mind is the result of a framework of thinking, usually transmitted culturally,\\n\\nthat leads to repetitive mental and physical action lifestyle.\\n\\nIf the culture you grew up in conditioned you to think that you cannot cook, or that you do not have time to cook, well, then here is the first recipe:\\n\\nDevelop a new framework of thinking.\\n\\nThe new way of cooking arises from that organically.\\n\\nCooking with only a little time to spare, with short resources?  You are in luck.\\n\\nOther than the phone in your pocket and few other developments, our modern schedule is not much different than that of a medieval peasant, and that style has been done before to perfection.  Especially in the kitchen.\\n\\nThe secret is to shift time.   \\n\\nYour personal time, in this era, comes in short burst intervals.\\n\\nInstead of eating as you run out the door, consider cooking on the way out.\\n\\nConsider that you have 48+ hours to prepare a meal in short interval bursts which address several micro-projects, each needing only a few seconds of daily attention.\\n\\nFor instance, an ongoing countertop / refrigerator type bread dough, might take an hour overall, but that hour is also in short burst intervals.   When you look at it on an instructional video, well, that’s as misleading as a book.  It’s not a chapter of complexity, just a simple handful of flour (your handful and pinch is a specific repeatable measure, that will lead to your personal signature in cooking -with lot’s less expense and dishwashing).  Now a stir of water with a chopstick.  Once you have your stage and rhythm it takes about 15 seconds.  Really.  Do this for several days and then one magical night when you make it back, simply pour the ‘bread batter’ into a heavy pan, do something fun time for the rise and then bake the bread in a pool of olive oil and sea salt.   Eat this loaf for the next days and continue to nourish your yeast empire.  You can do this in a ziplock next to your skin if needed, then bake it in a beer can.\\n\\nStir, pour, and bake.  It’s a mantra about time and relationship.\\n\\nThis way of thinking benefits all but the most royal ways of cooking, and leads to an easy ongoing harvest throughout the week.  Many times we are recommended to spend our weekends building a loaded freezer, but this swiftly becomes oppressive and regimented, the food tastes rushed because flavors we cherish generally develop over days not minutes.   Humans cooking can be more of a dance that enriches you and the ones you love, ever growing forward.  The food will nourish you physically, the act of cooking will nourish you emotionally.\\n\\nIf you are seriously short on time get a simple (easy to clean) single blade/bowl food processor and one of them instapot things.  A blender, the best you can get, cheap pans from the thrifts.  (I’m stuck on cast iron &lt;and the secret to cast iron is to simply use it every time you cook and don’t wash it, rather scrape out the particles with a Japanese style Tawashi coconut dish brush and hot tap water…..quick so you don’t remove the bottom layer of oil on the pan.  Nothing will grow on a frequently heated pan except for the rich seasoned patina every one seems to want for their irons.  This cast iron maintenance really takes about 15 seconds depending how far your sink is from your stove.\\n\\nAnd if you don’t have a kitchen, well, you can grow gardens in your pockets….I\\'ve sprouted seeds and beans, a handful in a heavy reusable ziplock….you can soak, rinse and sprout using your body heat in an inside pocket.  I have done this in Alaska.  Try a handful of bean sprouts next time you need a lift.  Some of the best nutrition you can get can travel with you as an ongoing living relationship thing.\\n\\nExpect an adventurous first month or so as you push through the necessary fears and failures of learning new things.  But in this case what you gain is more than a box of scribbled instructions.\\n\\nThis dance is inside of you already, and will nourish you and the ones you love for life. \\n\\n\\\\~ . \\\\~, About to start an office 9-5, lunch ideas welcome!As the title says, I\\'m about to start my very first 9-5 office position. I\\'ve had fulltime jobs before but they were either moderately physical and night shift so I\\'d bring my full dinner, the site provided food, or they were located a 5 minute walk from my house.

And some of the no salt added options get a bit boring quickly.\\n\\nOverall, my doc have advised to try sticking with the migraine regimen if possible (essentially, avoiding stuff: with preservatives; processed food with high monosodium glutamate content; fermented products, such as cheeses; chocolate (due to caffeine, so teas and coffee is out as well); nuts; egg white; fresh breads and yeast products; aged/processed meats; beans and fruits that have high histamine/tyramine content; and pickled or preserved fruits/vegetables).\\n\\nSugar is okay in moderate quantities, but it\\'s best to avoid as it can cause insulin spikes leading to reabsorbing more sodium and so on.\\n\\nSo... any ideas for snacks that I can eat mid morning and afternoon?, Mumi finger ....... carton song., Microwaving quick oats taking me wayy too longI buy a generic brand for pretty cheap.\\nMy oatmeal recipe is 1 cup oatmeal to 1 cup soy milk and 2 cups of water(weight gain diet).\\nWhen I put it for 8 min on high it\\'s still not ready.

Please send me some ideas for a small family to enjoy this feast!, Best one-person blender for smoothies in late 2021?Let me preface this by saying that I have done a lot of research, watched numerous videos comparing various blenders, from the basic nutribullet, to the entire line of vitamix blenders (starting at the ONE all the way up to a3500), and almost everything in between.\\n\\nWhile most people agree that you can\\'t go wrong with the vitamix, I\\'m thinking that it might not be the optimal blender for ME and my circumstances. So I\\'m asking for your advice.\\n\\n1) I don\\'t care about the longevity of the device. While 10 year warranties for vitamix are great, I don\\'t expect to stay in the US for more than a few years at most, and won\\'t be lugging a blender back with me. So a 2-3 year usability lifespan is totally ok for me.\\n\\n2) I live alone. I don\\'t actually need 64 oz containers, and think they might actually be worse for smoothies. My smoothies usually range from 20 to 26 oz. So too small containers are disqualified, and too big containers are a negative.\\n\\n3) What I do value, though, is that there are no chunks or chewies in the smoothie. I used to have a 300w generic blender back home and it had issues with leafy greens and some other ingredients.\\n\\n4) Also super important - a self-clean function. I would make smoothies almost every day, so if I can fill the container with warm water and put some dish soap to clean it, instead of putting it in the dishwasher, that\\'s a huge plus!\\n\\n**tl;dr** I\\'m looking for a blender for one person, who will be using it for smoothies from 20 to 26 oz in size, and \"smoothness\" is super important to me, as well as the ability to self-clean, while to durability of the device isn\\'t.

That being said, unless you live in a place where pumpkin is incredibly cheap and a jar of marina is oddly expensive, this probably won\\'t save you much money.

Or just straight out of the bowl with a spoon. But this + celery has become a pretty decent breakfast for me, as carb-heavy breakfasts give me pretty bad reactive hypoglycemia while this gives me zero issues. Good fats, fiber, protein, and keeps me full for a long while after just a few celery sticks dipped in this goodness.\\n\\nHealthy-wise, for how \"indulgent\" this tastes, I think the ingredients are pretty \"wholesome\", if fat and calorie dense (damn peanut butter!). So definitely don\\'t eat a whole bowl of this in one sitting if you\\'re counting cals. :)\\n\\nPricewise it\\'s only as expensive as the three ingredients. YMMV but for me, it\\'s peanuts. Pun intended.\\n\\nI\\'m also curious how this would work with vegan yogurt alternatives.\\n\\nPS: plain Greek yogurt is awesome. Mixing it with hot sauce for a guilt-free creamy buffalo dip is also really yummy., Meeting someone and trying to think of snack ideasI\\'m meeting with someone in the morning at my work tomorrow where I\\'m looking to be probing about one of the positions I\\'m interested in.

I make this once a day, every day:\\n\\n- 30g ground instant oats\\n\\n- 10g ground flax seeds\\n\\n- 10g ground chia seeds\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll add some protein powder and put that in almond milk.\\n\\nMy question is this: Can I make like 20 servings, and throw all of those servings into a tub. Then shake the tub. And at any point, I just scoop out 50g of it and that will be one serving? That\\'s how companies make their own nutrition powders right? (Vega, etc). \\n\\nMy main concerns are:\\n\\n1. Spoilage/rancidity\\n\\n2. After combining all of the servings into one big tub, then when I scoop out one 50g serving, would the ratios be the same as when I initially made every serving?, the best cauliflower for ballin\\' on a budget, promised to actually ~melt~ in your mouth&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img c1dndw5uce081...*\\n\\ncauliflower is for sure one of my top 5 favorite veggies. usually I just break it up and bake it, but this recipe comes with a twist: **you boil the whole cauliflower** for 15 minutes before roasting and/or broiling it!! this makes it perfectly smushy yet crispy on the outside. I love this recipe because it requires zero prep - except maybe washing the cauliflower :)   \\n\\n\\n**ingredients:**\\n\\n* one head of cauliflower\\n* any spices you want (I used curry powder, garlic salt &amp; powder, sesame seeds, and chili powder)\\n* salt\\n* olive oil\\n\\n**recipe:**\\n\\n1. salt a large pot of water and bring to a boil\\n2. boil entire cauliflower for \\\\~15 minutes until very tender (put a heat-proof plate or mug on top to keep it under water)\\n3. remove cauliflower from water and let it cool enough to coat with olive oil &amp; whatever spices you want\\n4. other spice options: cumin, minced garlic, lemon zest, paprika, onion powder, turmeric, ginger\\n5. Bake at 550 for 15-20 minutes, until dark golden brown. broil if you like it extra \\\\~crispy\\\\~\\n6. enjoy &amp; try not to burn your mouth because it\\'s so hot yet so bomb you can\\'t resist!!, I am looking for a very specific set of suggestions.I am on a sort of tight budget. I\\'m looking for low effort but still healthy food for cheap. Preferably available on amazon prime with EBT. I suffer from bipolar depression and diabetes. I also don\\'t really know how to cook with my stove, but can follow instructions.\\n\\nI have an air fryer that I\\'m familiar with, but not a rice cooker. Those 2 things and the microwave and deep fryer are the main cooking machines I have to work with.\\n\\nI really like meet and cheese, but not beans. I also like most veggies and some fruits.\\n\\nAny suggestions for someone trying to lose weight?, side effects of lemonade'"

    "For both bodyweightfitness and EatCheapAndHealthy reddit posts, the sentiment analysis is quite similar and fairly positive. About 14-15% of the total text is read as positive, which is more than double that of negative text at about 5-6%. Neutral text forms the majority, accounting for 80% of total text. More commendably, the compound score (normalized score (-1 to 1) based on the sum of negative, neutral and positive scores) for both is 1.0, indicating a high level of positivity. This is not unsurprising as discussions for both subreddits mainly revolve around individuals seeking improvement in a particular aspect of his/her life, where most other users respond with practical advice and/or words of encouragement. \n"
