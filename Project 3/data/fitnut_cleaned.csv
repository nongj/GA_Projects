combining grease the groove with my usual workout,"Hi all!

I have a question that has been in my head for a few days now... I want to try and grease the groove with weighted pull-ups (+10kg), I have a vest at home and a pull-up bar so it is easy to do. My max is around 11 but I'm starting gtg with 4 reps I think, if that's the wrong approach please let me know!

So I also do like a full upper body workout once every 5 days or something, where I do several back and chest exercises, including inverted rows and pull-ups/chin-ups. Is it possible to combine this with grease the groove? Like do the upper body workout on Monday, Tuesday rest and gtg from Wednesday till Saturday or something and do the upper body day on Sunday again, or is this not smart at all to do?

Or is it better to drop my pull-up exercise from the upper body day?

Any help and feedback would be much appreciated!!",0,"combining grease the groove with my usual workoutHi all!

Will bodyweight exercises help to slim down a muscular figure?,"I'm a 5'3 , 137 lbs female. I've always focused on lifting as heavy as possible when working out, so I've always had a pretty muscular physique. I've never had a problem with this previously, but lately I've been wanting to slim down my thighs and calves so they're a little more proportional to my height. I've already slimmed down some, but I'm still not where I want to be yet. My current thigh and calf measurements are 25"" and 14"" respectively. I've still been doing 3-4 leg days a week, just lifting lighter weights and limiting myself to 3 reps each. Now, I'm looking to cut out weights entirely for my lower body and focus on bodyweight exercises. Will this be effective in helping me slim my legs while keeping a toned look, or will I just maintain my current size? Also, if anyone has any suggestions for good routines, I'm all ears. I'm very new to this and just don't want to feel like I'm going too easy on myself.",0,"Will bodyweight exercises help to slim down a muscular figure?I'm a 5'3 , 137 lbs female.

Difficulty in recovering from workouts,"I've been having difficulty in recovering from my workouts. Male, 5'6"" (167cm), 195lb (89kg), \~16-20% body fat. I like to train to be generally all around athletic and mobile - so flexibility, strength, endurance, jack of all trades master of none, though my primary goal is fat loss (I'd like to hit \~12% body fat and maintain that). I run twice a week for 30min, leg day twice a week for 30min, and upper body day twice a week for about an hour. I do a 20min yoga routine after each workout, so that's 6 days a week I'm active. I can provide more detail upon request, but usually when I run I just vary my pace depending on how I feel, I use a lower body calisthenics routine largely derived from knees over toes guy, and my upper body routine is mostly rings based from coach Sommer's book, about half of the workout on isometrics and the other half on dynamics.

  
I'm thinking about perhaps moving the running in concert with my leg day in order to grant me two additional rest days, but I'm not really sure if running after my lower body day is a good idea. I'd like to hear what other people have to say. I'm somewhat open to removing running altogether, which I've done in the past but I always eventually add it back in because I enjoy cardio and find its benefits useful.

I'll also add that my environment is generally stressful and that for sure impacts my recovery, but there isn't much I can do about that at the moment (I'm writing my dissertation as a PhD student, for one).",0,"Difficulty in recovering from workoutsI've been having difficulty in recovering from my workouts.

For People Starting Bodyweight training (Men &amp; Woman,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ THE WHOLE POST BEFORE LEAVING ANY GOOD OR BAD OPINIONS.

So I have seen a lot of posts on here about how to start off, what equipment to buy or how to structure a program with very little to no exercising experience so here is a little advice but I really hope you read through this whole thing.

First of all...you have to be realistic here, you need equipment like a dip bar and a pull-up bar, or a dip station with pull up bar, or Gymnastic Rings (Yes even as a beginner you can use them, i know because ive helped a few friends using only rings) if you want to make the best gaines possible. I personally have a standing pull up bar and rings attached to it and its really good! 

Now im not saying you cant make some gaines without the equipment (Starting out) but it is recommended to have something or atleast one piece of equipment (get the rings in my opinion), So save up or do something if you really want to make the best progress possible because id be lying to you and so is everyone else that says ""you dont really need equipment to workout bro just do 100 push ups every day and some ab workouts"" I was told that crap when i first started my fitness journey and it was hella discouraging when I couldn't even do 3 push up consecutively or never saw the results I wanted.

Now sometimes parks have a pull up bar or even calisthenics equipment so you can also try that

Equipment ive used/recommend:
http://www.gymsupreme.com/?product=mega-bar

You can get the equipment i recommended earlier on amazon but if you decide to buy rings try to buy them with the longest strap possible and the biggest ring size, it just makes the rings more useful and comfortable in my opinion but its not a must if you dont want to.

Now for the good stuff ;)

You might have seen me recommend these youtubers, Austin Dunham and Brendan Meyers on a few other posts but that's because i used to watch them when I first started my calisthenics Journey and their programs really helped me out a lot especially Brandan Meyers body evo program which was the first program ive ever bought and saved up for when i was 15 and i dont regret it till this day. So what I'm going to do is share that program and Austin's for you guys to enjoy and help kick start your journey and use it as a foundation for future programs that you may want to build later on your own, but if you choose to go another route or do your own research that's fine but I honestly recommend these programs as a Foundation because now I make my own programs but every once in awhile I'll reference back to these programs just for fun.

A little Ring program from Daniel Vadnal for yall

https://anonfiles.com/F0NdMf9cxc/Body_by_rings_zip

I recommend downloading the programs on your computer with an ad blocker and if you want you can even scan it with an anti-virus if you're a little skeptical but youll be fine downloading it normally.

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
When choosing a program or buying one on your own please for the love of God stick to it follow it to the T (unless you have to substitute an exercise because you can't physically do it or don't have the equipment)  and don't deviate from it you'd be surprised how many people will buy or use these programs and not stick to them and complain about not seeing results because they decided to only try it out for a week maybe. That's not how things work, good things don't come easily.

Lastly I just want to say that no I don't know everything there is to working out, I am learning just as much as you are but from the little that I have been able to learn through these few years I sure do wish I knew it then.

And please don't quit!! It will be hard it will be tough it's going to challenge you but you have already taken the first step to changing your life in a way you don't even know yet, and you have a whole Community that's here to support you, &amp; and if No One Believes In You at least you know I do.
Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope it helps at least one of you :)

I want to get healthy. I want to do bodyweight workouts as it seems to be more my style than going to a gym , I am not able to go to gym due to time constraints. Weight training also isn't something I could see myself doing for a long time.
I am interested in bodyweight workouts as it seems to be more easy going for me and something that I could do for a long period of time to yield the desired results.
The results I am looking for is physical as well as mental, as losing weight and being in a better shape would help me feel less of a burden and studies have shown that people suffering from anxiety get improved quality of life if they integrate workouts in their daily routine.
I need your guidance in learning what's a good place to begin doing it as a overweight man, I am asking this so don't start working out things that are better for fit people and end up damaging my joints, muscles.
My current fitness level if it helps is following
I can hold a plank for upto 1 minute, 35 squats
My second question is about push-ups.

"Is there a name for ""flowing calisthenics on the floor""?","Tl;Dr: Is there a specific way to call the side aspect of calisthenics done on the floor in a flowing manner, like GMB or Animal Flow?

I started my fitness journey several years ago as an overweight person. I always felt like bodyweight fitness was the way to go, but I sincerely couldn't pull anything in my sad condition. Instead, I passionately started powerlifting, then moved to kettlebells at the beginning of the pandemic. I am now so many pounds lighter (30kg/65lbs) and younger as a 40yo dad than I have ever been. Never really cared about hypertrophy anyway.

I have discovered Animal Flow several months ago, then moved to GMB that I absolutely love. Finishing GMB Elements at the moment. While still a beginner, I have good mobility and sufficient strength to progress rapidly and pull tricks I am humbly pretty proud of.

Therefore, I would like to explore this aspect of calisthenics further: flowing, crawling, having fun on the floor and moving from one pose to the next in an ""effortless"" manner. How should I search for new ideas on the interweb? Calisthenics as a keyword brings a lot of stuff with rings and implements that I am less interested in.

Also, I would be very grateful if you fine people could recommend YT channels and stuff around what I described.",0,"Is there a name for ""flowing calisthenics on the floor""?Tl;Dr: Is there a specific way to call the side aspect of calisthenics done on the floor in a flowing manner, like GMB or Animal Flow?

What's the best easy to follow program for someone at Beginner/Intermediate level?,"Looking for a structured program anywhere from 30 - 90 days plus, willing to pay. Currently doing the Recommended Routine (RR) looking for a program to follow after. I mainly plan to workout at home, equipment I have: dip bars, pull up bar, dumbbells, bench, various workout bands, jump rope, yoga mat. Additionally I am part of a decent rock climbing gym. Always been interested in a body that would focus on calisthenics something good for parkour/bouldering/ninja warrior courses. I would say currently I'm in okay shape, have been working out consistently for the past year and half plus. Mainly home workouts from Beach Body programs such as: P90x, LIFT4, The Work, 645. Recently started bouldering for the past month. Planning to start bicycling again for cardio improving once the weather is a bit warmer.

"Can I alternate cardio/strength days if I'm using body weight/calisthenics, or is it better to rest?","Like many people, I've started a workout routine this year. I've taken one big lesson to heart: The best fitness routine is the one you actually do. So I've realized that I can do a five minute warmup workout first thing in the morning, and a 10-15 minute workout after work, and I've been sticking to it 5 days a week so far. It fits my schedule, I haven't burned myself out trying to do more than I can do.

My issue is rest and recovery. I'm trying to do strength workouts one day, alternate cardio the next. I don't like running, and it's too cold to jump rope, so I'm doing burpees and mountain climbers and such. But, since I'm not lifting weights, it's like I'm doing the same exercises every day.

Yes, I'm overthinking it. Yes, I know I'm talking about a 10 minute workout, not training like The Rock. Building good habits is more important right now than the minutiae of hypertrophy and triglycerides. 

Basically, I want to know if I'm overtraining myself doing HIIT workouts that work the whole body, with one day focusing on building strength and the next focusing on speed.",0,"Can I alternate cardio/strength days if I'm using body weight/calisthenics, or is it better to rest?Like many people, I've started a workout routine this year.

Looking to be able to complete a front lever by the end of the year. As well as planche in 2 years. I have 3 years total lifting and calisthenics experience.

I oftentimes find myself missing workouts due to no equipment/ late nights/ crazy schedule as I work in music.

I wish to change.,"I want to change.

For context: 

Hello. I am a seventeen year old female high school student who has been overweight my entire life. I currently live in the normal suburban town area in the United States with my family including my mother, father, respected grandmothers, and brother. Becoming healthier has always been a want in my life. I want to attend the gym. I want to diet. I want to do what is best for my body. But in the current circumstances I’m in, everything just seems so unpromising and difficult to follow through with. I really don’t know what to do. 

Living with my family means adjusting to the diet plan of the house. My whole family is overweight, and do not seem to desire change in their lifestyles. The pantry is full of cookies and chips galore, healthy alternatives such as fruits and vegetables can rarely be seen, and the common dinner meal is usually a greasy, high calorie, take out dish, as everyone is too lazy to cook a decent home cooked meal. Although I want to provide the things to better my diet myself, the nearest grocery market is about an hour walk both ways, making it impossible for me to carry everything I buy back home. It doesn’t help that a huge snow storm came by making the roads and pavement walks icy. I don’t have a car or any other form of transportation to get me anywhere either. I would also like to attend a gym so I can get myself engaged in a motivational environment with people that obtain the same goal as me, to become healthier. However, the closest gym to my house is about a two hour walk one way. Especially with it being junior year, trying to balance school on top of that would be difficult and I would end up walking home alone in the evenings, which is quite scary to me. 

I try to do at home workouts, but I constantly face judgement from my family members. They laugh and make fun of me for dieting, and often approach me with a snarky tone for trying. I have lost the confidence to try anything in front of family, and just pray to get accepted into my dream university in an urban area where everything I wish to utilize can be easily accessible/obtainable for me.

Fixing my hunchback in the gym?,"F (19), I have had double scoliosis since i was a teen and i have a hunchback, and it makes me really insecure. I was soppoused to do exercises for it when i was younger but i didnt take it seriously. My biggest problem is when i bend over or stretch my back gets so round, im so embarassed so i mostly never stretch in the gym. It makes me feel so unfeminine, unattractive, insecure and i feel like it makes my glute gains less visible (since my back is more round than my butt lol). I train my back twice a week, but I feel like its not that effective. I feel like its never going to get better and no matter how much i exercise im always going to be insecure.

Doing pullups with ab straps,"  

Currently with a stupid case of tendinitis, I see myself forcefully forbidden to do any pulling exercises, having a sharp pain if I do so.

I have been trying to fix it and it seems it will take long. And so I don't want advice on how to fix it per say. But I was wondering if anyone has used ab straps to do pull ups and how convenient will it be for my case (I want to do pull ups). Also if adding weight seems possible or not and overall you guys opinions.

"Need to improve my push-up capacity, any tips?","Hey all, so I've been doing the RR and variations of it for a few months now, with reasonable success. However, I'm still pretty behind on my push-up capacity.

For example, I'm at nearly-horizontal rows for inverted rows and can easily do much more than my initial limit, and I've definitely progressed on exercises like deadbugs and ring ab rollouts/planks. But for push-ups, I'm still at incline push-ups, I've barely even managed to lower the incline, and I can still only barely manage the amount that I started at... 

What can I do to improve/increase my push-up capacity? Are there any exercises, stretches, etc. that I can do at home? (Right now I have access to a gym -- and I try to do a bench-press, squats, barbell rows, and deadlifts there at least 2-3 times a week -- but gyms are closing and I'm not sure how safe it'll be to go for the next month, so I'm preparing to do as much of the RR as I can at home.)

Lower back questions/advice,"Hi!

I’m quite the rookie at calistenics as I’ve only been working for about 6 months. I would still consider myself close to average since I can manage 10+ pullups and 15+ dips(not trying to brag just so you know my approx. current strength).

So my question is regarding exercises that target the lower back. In the program I’m following there are Skin The Cat exercises. I can’t really do them without bending my arms, but other than that I had no problem with them. But a month or so into doing them I started to get severe back pain. Taking deep breaths would physically hurt for example. So I simply stopped doing them altogether.

I’m not sure if this is because the exercise is really difficult and shouldnt be done until proper strength has been achieved. Or perhaps im doing it wrong? 

So I’m just looking for some advice as to how to move forward. Are there any other good exercises for the lower back that I could swap it out for?

34M, 5’7” (170cm), and \~152lb (69kg).  I’ve been working out on and off for 16 years without any real guidance.  Currently, I only have access to a pullup bar, so I am doing bodyweight exercises for now.  I have three goals--the immediate ones are to lose weight to get a visible six pack and to increase the number of weighted pullups/chinups I can do, and my longer term goal is to gain as much muscle as I can (hypertrophy).  The FAQ “Is My Workout Good?” section indicates that a good routine “Doesn't include high rep situps or crunches,” so should I break up my 3-100 rep sets of crunches into more sets of fewer reps?  I use a calorie tracker.  I rest every other day.  I’m thinking about adding the Front Lever in one of the days, and, soon, I’m going to do 2 sets each of weighted pullups and chinups, decreasing the regular pullups and chinups to 3 sets each.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve my program, I would be most appreciative.

Is this workout routine alright?,"Hey there! I’m new to fitness. I started working out about 8 weeks ago. So far, all my strength numbers have been going up, and I’ve noticed some size gains. All has been well and good to my knowledge..

However! I wanted to write out my routine, and ask if there’s anything MORE I could be doing? Even with the success so far, I’m worried that I’ll learn later on that I did something wrong, and left potential strength gains and muscle growth on the table. 

So, with that being said! Here we go. 

I’ve been running a PUSH/PULL/LEGS split, hitting each day twice a week. Sunday REST.

I should also note, I rest 2 minutes between sets, but I alternate the exercises back and forth. 

For example, I’ll do 1 set of OHP, REST 2min, and do 1 set of Tricep Pushdowns, REST 2min, and go back to OHP, rest, and so on until I get 4 sets of each, like so-

Overhead Press for 10 reps.
[REST 2MIN]
Tricep Pushdowns for 12 reps
[REST 2MIN]
Overhead Press for 10 reps.
[REST 2MIN]
Tricep Pushdowns for 12 reps
[REST 2MIN]

[REST 2MIN]
Tricep Pushdowns for 12 reps
[REST 2MIN]
Overhead Press for 10 reps.
[REST 2MIN]
Tricep Pushdowns for 12 reps
[REST 2MIN]

For PUSH:

1. 4 sets 8-10/Overhead Press - 4 sets 12/Tricep Pushdowns

2. 4 sets of 8-10/Bench Press - 4 sets of 12/Lateral Raises (I’ve been using Rest-Pause to grind out some extra reps on Lateral Raises)

3. 4 sets of 8-10/Weighted Ring Dips - 4 sets of 12/Skullcrushers

————————————

For PULL:

1. 4 sets 8-10/Weighted Ring Pull Ups - 4 sets 12/FacePulls

2. 4 sets of 8-10/Dumbbell Curls - 4 sets of 12/Shrugs

3. 4 sets of 8-10/Ring Rows - 4 sets of 12/Lat Pull Down

————————————

For LEGS:

1. 4 sets 8-10/Barbell Squats - 4 sets 12/Nordic Curls (not super great at these yet)

2. 4 sets of 8-10/Romanian Deadlift - 4 sets of 12/Calf Raises

3. 4 sets of 8-10/Bulgarian Split Squat - 4 sets of 12/Barbell Hip Thrusts

And that’s it!! I also hit abs everyday, with 3 round circuit of ab roll outs, crunches and hanging leg raises.

For the sets that say 8-10, I usually take those 1 rep short of failure. And once I get 4 sets of 10, I increase the weight. and the sets that are 12, I take those to failure, until I can get 12+ on all 4 sets before I increase weight. 

With that being said, let me know what I can fix, what you think, if it’s good, if it’s not. or if this is one of those “if it ain’t broke-“ situations. Haha!

Yes, genetics play a huge role. But that doesn’t mean yours can’t grow.

There’s some people who don’t even work out and have huge Glutes. There’s some people who do minimal work on their Glutes, but still get amazing results on them.

"Properly training for future, more advanced exercises?","Hello calisthenics athletes, I'm currently doing 4 sets of +5kg pull ups (aprox. 10 reps) and trying to improve both numbers and/or weight, whatever comes first.

Is this a good approach for harder exercises later on? Just checked and exercises like archer and typewriter pull ups seem to be harder than my shoulders-width weighted pull ups, mainly because the former use more lats compared to the later.

Is this a good way of training? Taking into account muscle ups and front lever, which are even more advanced exercises, need more strength and technique.

So what do I do? Do I keep pushing for more strength or should I do a combination of sets? Weighted set + wide grip set + chin up set + archer set, etc?

The same applies to other exercises like dips (weighted dips vs russian and imposible dips) push ups (HSPU vs archer/one hand push ups) and so on.",0,"Properly training for future, more advanced exercises?Hello calisthenics athletes, I'm currently doing 4 sets of +5kg pull ups (aprox. 10 reps) and trying to improve both numbers and/or weight, whatever comes first.

"Feeling a little lost and in limbo, have you guys been where I have been and which direction did you go?","Long story short, I'm more of less where I want to be with my physique.

The problem is the maintenance to keep it this way is just way more than I can spend now on a consistent basis. When I started this process, it was fun; because at first it was casual and it wasn't overly demanding in my personal time. But as my progress grew, so did the work required to achieve it as well and it's become a bit of a time sink. I used to look forward to my routines because they were fun, I finished feeling good and I was even pumped up after my sessions. But now I'm dreading my sessions as although I achieved where I want to be, but my sessions requirements have ballooned so much in both time and the weights I push.

Right now I'm at an impasse. Should I scale back, lose some gains but get back to just having fun again?

Table Row - Parallel vs Perpendicular Grip,"Hi. 34 years old male here. Currently at 90kgs. In an effort to control my blood sugar (T1D) and stay healthy, I started the bodyweight exercises. I am doing the BWF Primer right now (Week 2, Day 9). Healtly diet is also on the list.I may be a bit too much focusing on little things, but if it can prevent future injury, why not right? ) My question is which grip is better when doing the table row, parallel to your body or perpendicular?

I don't have any suitable table because the legs are in the middle. I also read here that the row is a 'must do exercise'. I know the are many alternatives to replace the table,.For now I am doing it with dumbell pull and in the meantime I am designing a sort of specialized apparatus to do it properly. As of right now I am in the position to make it better (if any) and I also have the ability to make the grip orientation any direction I want.

I have seen the barbell with parallel grip where you kinda stand in the middle when lifting it. If the regular barbell is good, why is there other type of grip for it?

If you guys can give me some pointer about the grip orientation it will be badass!

Ring Chin Up Progressions,"Hi everyone, so I'm training for the one arm chin up, I do one finger assisted Chin ups on rings and Mantle Chin ups on rings (assisting ring lower). However with Mantle Chin ups I completely stopped progressing because I just can't pull high enough with my right arm. I don't know if it's normal, with my left arm I can pull till my chin is above the whole ring but with my right, I can barely get my chin above the bottom of the ring. What are the best Chin up progressions that I could replace the Mantle Chin up with? Archer Chin ups? Or should I do weighed Chin ups to build more strength? That would be limited though, because I train at the park and would have to carry weights in a backpack.",0,"Ring Chin Up ProgressionsHi everyone, so I'm training for the one arm chin up, I do one finger assisted Chin ups on rings and Mantle Chin ups on rings (assisting ring lower).

Would anyone be interested in a workout generator app?,"Context: I'm a professional Software Engineer who likes working out (and really likes callisthenics/bodyweight training) and want to make something for myself. Just want to see if anyone else would be interested in it  


A while ago, I came up with the idea for an app that would generate a random workout based on a series of parameters (equipment owned, ability level, duration of workout etc).   
This was when I was between programs but still wanted to work out, but wasn't sure what to do for the workouts.  


The way I'd see it is like this  


1. Enter the parameters needed (equipment, ability, muscles to work etc)
2. Press a button
3. Have a workout ready to do that is tailored to your requirements

Simple as that. Now obviously this isn't designed to replace a dedicated workout program, but is rather for the times when you want to workout but don't know what to do. Eg, in between programs  


I was planning on making this for myself and just using exercises I know and love, but if people were interested I could expand it out a bit.

16F - 48KG &amp; 168 CM - Want to Gain Weight,"&amp;#x200B;

Technically underweight at the moment, though I don't think I look it.1

Nonetheless, from a health POV, I want to gain some weight, and get to around 52 kg - however, I still want to look/stay slim.

From my understanding, the ideal way to do this would be to lift weights. However, as someone who has never worked out - I'm wondering if lifting weights would make a difference? Like I'm pretty sure most of my weight is all fat and no muscle, and I have no arm muscles or slight abs or anything of the sort. Want to gain weight by toning my body essentially.

Any tips for a novice weight lifter like me? Perhaps the weight amount, and times I should lift in accordance to my age and weight ATM?

workout ideas,"Hi, I'm an 18-year-old female in college. Currently, I weight train. I started during high school and came up with a 3 day a week plan. Since then I've plateaued and just don't find the routine fun. Going into the next semester I want to work out five times a week. In addition, I want to get back into running. I used to run cross country and am looking to run a marathon in October. Does anyone have any cool variations or just different routines to gain muscle but increase endurance?

Critique My Beginner Workout Routine!,"Hi guys and gals.

Here are my stats:

* 27 male
* 150 lbs / 68.3 kgs
* 5'11"" / 183 cms
* ""Skinny fat"" physique

I started to ease into calisthenics about 1/1.5 months ago and have zero clue as to what I am doing. I figured I'll just work some basic muscle groups, get a bit stronger, and then try to refine a little later. ""Better than nothing"" is the philosophy.  


Here's where I'm at today:

* 7 x pullups (strict)
* 31 x push ups (strict)
* 30 seconds planche hold (knees tucked to chest, using pushup grips)
* 13 x Incline pushups (using pushing up grips)
* 25 seconds L-Sit (90 degrees hold)
* 15 x dips
* 15 x supinated pullups
* 15 x close-grip incline pushups 
* 15 x dip crunches / L-Sit Crunch (don't know the name for this)

So this is where I'm at. Any tips/pointers? I want to start incorporating more dynamic, full body exercises and ranges of motion and start training my core and shoulders more to eventually get to a full planche (one can dream right?).  


My equipment:

* dip bars
* pull up bar (attached to door frame)
* Push up Grips
* Piano bench (lol)

Wishlist:

* resistance bands
* Rings (but I have nowhere to attach them to and train with in the winter months)
* Weighted vest
* Ab rolley thingy (not sure what it's called)

Getting in Shape?,"Hi all,

I’m a 22 yo guy looking to start getting in shape. I have started dieting/counting calories and drinking more water so I’m hoping that helps with the weight loss portion, and I’d like to explore options to start generally just getting in good shape. Right now I’m walking for about 15-20 minutes 3-4 times weekly. I’d like to potentially start hiking and walking longer distances. How can I get started other than this? I looked over the “Minimalist” routine, would this be best? I don’t think I can do more than 5 push-ups at a time sadly, so I have a long way to go. I’d like to avoid weightlifting or having to go to the gym to workout, so I think Calisthenics would be beneficial in that regard. Would it be possible to get in shape and stay active doing just cardio and calisthenics? Assuming I continue eating right?

I would greatly appreciate any help or advice you can provide.

Why does one of my elbow hurts when doing pushing exercises or L sits?,"I’m 15, 5’11, weight 72kg, male and I started doing body weight exercises some months ago (like 7-9).

Rn I can do 15-25 push ups, 6-10 seconds L sits 3 chin ups and 2 pull ups.

I’m “skinny fat” now not so much but when I started I was.

The pain I feel in my elbow it’s like a light pain but when I do exercises it starts to hurt a lot.

I'm quessing it was bc once when I was doing clapping push ups I didn't land well bc my hands get sweaty really fast and I slipped. After that it hurt for a few days and the pain eventually went away. But now it's back and idk what to do.

After that I didn’t do any kind of exercising for some weeks until it went away.

My elbow sounds like is cracking or popping when I extend my arm even if I'm not doing any exercises. And it used to relieve the pain when I do pull ups or chin ups but now not su much.

I thinks this is what is holding me back to be able to do some of the body weight exercises that I want to do (like handstand and handstand push ups bc when I do pike push ups it also starts to hurt and can’t continue)

Need a newbie advice and opinion!,"Hi! So, I started to work out recently and for the first stage before signing up for a gym, I bought a Dumbbell set of 30kg. 

I use this set to lift 2 weights of 14.9kg, and combining them with a connector to lift 30kg, as well as some Kettlebell and pushups. 

I increased my diet as far as possible, and try my best to do daily sessions and increase the count of times / sets each time. I also bought some whey drink with 25g protein to take after the practice. 

Yet, I still feel like I do something wrong or not right per say. I would love advice and tips! 

Also, is it realistic of me to expect some mass gain (mainly in my arms since I'm too thin there) and the period I should expect for the ""gains"" to be noticed?

Newbie here!,"Hey what’s up guys! 

I’m 28 years old, roughly 5ft 9/10 and hitting the scales at 119.7kg. I’m a chunky lad but I carry it quite well all things considered.

I’ve been lifting weights for a little bit of time and learning the basics and form. But I’m now interesting in really changing my body.

I’ve come to terms with the fact thatI’m carrying way too much BF and need to go on a effective cut.

I’ve downloaded MyFitnessPal to help me keep track of what’s going in and after day 1, I’m shocked by it and completely understand why I weigh so much. I’ve consumed approx 2000 calories today and It’s not stretched to far. I’ve cut sugars, I’ve had a bagel with my scrambled eggs and bacon but I think I’m going to have to lose the bagel as it’s mad. 

I’ve now started making records of my workouts because I want to work for that body and I’m willing to put in the work.

"Recommend routine, what's next?","Hello Everyone,

This is probably a recurrent question here. Sorry for that...

I have been doing the recommended routine for 3months now, and I am almost at the final level of all the progressions. Thank you for the routine; it helps me get back in shape and feel better doing my everyday tasks.

So, I would like to get some suggestions on how to continue progressing. I am already using rings and weights, and I don't mind buying more equipment to do different exercises. My main goal is to increase my core strength and start seeing a better definition of my abs.

For reference, I am doing the recommended routine three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays); on Tuesdays, I am doing 1h15min of HIIT, and on Thursdays, a 15k run. Usually, Saturday and Sunday are rest days, but If I feel like it, I do a 50min body combat on Saturdays.

Calisthenics (and bouldering) post-creatine,"In brief: stopped taking creatine after almost 2 years, mostly out of curiosity (wanted to see what the effects might be).

Why do ab workouts burn so much compared to others?,"When I do ab workouts, I have to stop based on pain and burning of my ab muscles, but not in the same way as other muscles.

For example, if I do push-ups to failure I literally cannot do the movement from pure muscle fatigue. My muscles just will not do the work and it's impossible to lift myself up, but not from a sensation of pain or burning. My muscles just will not do it.

But when I do ab exercises, I have to stop just from the sheer burning sensation, but seems like if I'd be able to push through that pain I'd be able to continue for longer. I also feel like I can't breathe well and have to take conscious deep breaths after I stop to relieve the pain in my abs before I can continue again.

Why is there such a big difference here in the experience of muscle fatigue, and is what I'm experiencing normal? Is it safe to try to try mental conditioning to push through that pain to try to prolong the exercise?",0,"Why do ab workouts burn so much compared to others?When I do ab workouts, I have to stop based on pain and burning of my ab muscles, but not in the same way as other muscles.

"Been doing pistol squats for ~8 years, ankles suddenly on fire as I go down","This is a very recent development - started 2~3 months ago.

Right around the height [this person is at](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pistol-squat-1630407779.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=640:*), my ankles start feeling like they are **on fire and lock up** in the FRONT of the ankle ([this spot](https://imgur.com/a/JPnFZLL))

Any thoughts on what could be the problem here?  I first thought it might be my calves, but I don't get why the fire is in the front of the ankles in that case.

Some observations:
1. This started happening not just in pistol squats but in deep squats like asian squats too, neither of which had ever bothered me in my life until this started a few months ago.
2. Like mentioned in title, pistol squats I had been doing them for 8 years now casually, ankle flexibility had NEVER been an issue for me. 
3. It's not just soreness - my ankles as I start dropping will also lock up / freeze up, and the only way for me to go all the way down at that point is either to force it down (someone pushing me down or by holding a heavy weight), or lean back and drop on to my bum and then getting back on to the bottom of the pistol squat from the ground.",0,"Been doing pistol squats for ~8 years, ankles suddenly on fire as I go downThis is a very recent development - started 2~3 months ago.

How can body weight fitness transform females?,"Hey everyone, I’m new to this sub. I, 23F, am a single mom with no license Atm(working on it lol) and I’m a full time student. I had a gym routine and was able to get there but with school starting back up, it’s hopeless. The closest gym is 30 minutes away and I have a very packed schedule. 
Anyway, I’d like to get back into calisthenics.  I’ve been on a fitness journey for about a year now, I started with only cardio and slowly got into calisthenics and looked the best I ever did only a few months into my journey. Then I made my way onto fitness tiktok which had me feeling terrible bc I wasn’t lifting heavy… so I started to. But I quickly realized that with my circumstances, getting to the gym really isn’t possible for me (which is okay!!) 
Moving on. I’ve decided to start my calisthenics journey again. My question is… 

How much can a girl change her body through only at home workouts/calisthenics? I’m feeling a little discouraged because I’ve not found anyone online with jaw dropping transformations or anything like that. 
My goal is to lose body fat and to gain some lean muscle mass. I don’t need to be a beef ball, that dream has died (maybe one day though) but to just achieve that healthy toned look throughout my entire body :)
I’d love to know about some female calisthenics influencers if y’all know of any!!! 

Also, if Anyone has any words of encouragement or advice, please feel free to share. I can do some push-ups but I can’t do a single pull up. I also need advice on strengthening my back. WHY IS LIFE HARD.

Absolute beginner. Doing C25k but thinking of adding BWF Primer. Worried about losing out on potential gains,"I finished my first week of C25k. I will start Week 2 tomorrow but I was thinking of adding in the Primer.

My concern is the following: Despite finishing the first week of C25k, I don’t think I have a good cardio base. After every run, I feel completely destroyed gasping for water (though slightly less so with every run I take).

Despite the fact that I feel good after a couple of bodyweight exercises (like a massage you do on yourself), I worry that if I do the exercises on the days I’m not running, because of my couch potato-level cardio stamina and physique, I could be disrupting any potential gains by not resting.

Should I:
A) Finish the C25k to Week 9 (the final week) first and then start on BWFP Primer. In this case, I would make my schedule one of the following:

         1. M: BWFP

            W: BWFP

I made an app to track individual muscle training frequency and training volume,"I've used a multitude of workout tracking apps for my gymnastics ring training as well as tradition gym training, the first one I got worked okay for about 6 months, but then one day all my data was just gone. Next I used ""Strong"" and I still use it to this day to track every workout, but the only shortcoming is that I found myself getting so involved in the details of every rep, set and exercise that it was hard to focus on the bigger picture: training each muscle frequently, and with adequate training volume, specifically I wanted to make sure I trained each muscle at least twice per week with a certain amount of sets for each muscle group.

At first I just used a spreadsheet, but after a few weeks, I kept thinking that it just wasn't very convenient or user friendly to have to open a spreadsheet, tap to open the keyboard, type something in, dismiss keyboard and repeat for each muscle group as I trained, I wanted something that wouldn't distract me from my workout, because tracking my sets and reps in strong was already enough of a distraction.

So I made ""Built Training Log"" pretty much entirely to solve my own problem, however I now see that it could be of use to much more people.

Link: https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1576488381?pt=123286328&amp;ct=bodyweightfitness&amp;mt=8

It's basically a grid of 3 state buttons with muscles or exercises on the Y axis and the 7 days of the week as the X axis, with a sets column on the end to make sure you get enough training volume. First you plan out your week by tapping all the muscles / exercises you want to do on each day, then during your workout, all you have to do is tap to fill in the planned blocks after you've completed all sets for each muscle group / exercise.

Tracking my training has been a breeze ever since I finished this app so I hope others find it just as useful as I do.

Not sure if this is against the rules or not, just wanted to share this because I think it could make a lot of peoples lives easier when it comes to tracking workouts.",0,"I made an app to track individual muscle training frequency and training volumeI've used a multitude of workout tracking apps for my gymnastics ring training as well as tradition gym training, the first one I got worked okay for about 6 months, but then one day all my data was just gone.

How to excel at both bodyweight and gym training?,"Hey guys, anyone here successfully start doing bodyweight training (planches, handstands, etc.) while also seriously doing gym training (powerlifting or bodybuilding)?

For reference, I've been doing a mix of bodybuilding + powerlifting for 5+ years consistently. I'm decently advanced, with a 550 lbs deadlift, 300 bench, and 350 squat at 6'1 height and 177 lbs bodyweight. 

I still want to pursue some gym PRs, but want to start doing more bodyweight fitness training beyond pull-ups, dips, and weighted pushups. I think it would be fun to be more of a dynamic athlete vs strictly being good at moving weights around.

Anyone here excel at both types of training simultaneously? If so, how do you balance both? Have you found them to be synergistic, or you have to accept a slower rate of progress on each.

I want to try to do 100 push ups each day and I have a few questions. Mainly how they affect other workouts.,"Is it okay to also do regular workouts while doing push ups everyday? How will it affect my muscles being able to rest/ grow from workout to workout?

I also don’t have access to a gym, so I’m using adjustable dumbells at home, along with bodyweight workouts, like pushups, dips. I’m going to add planks and other bodyweight only ab workouts, but I want to get into a routine first. 

My intention of doing 100ish pushups everyday is to get into a routine of working out (I have adhd and struggle with consistency without routine.) Also, I’ve read that 100 pushups everyday is a great to start building up strength. Lastly, having a tangible goal of 100 pushups to do everyday will hopefully help with motivation and momentum with other workouts too. 

Furthermore, I know that the number of 100 pushups isn’t really important. I’ve been more focusing on doing as much as I can throughout the day. I’ve been doing mostly wall pushups, but trying to do 20 or so floor pushups for variation and training. Are wall pushups effective? Or should I try to build up to more floor pushups? I’m using knees for floor pushups right now. I also can’t do regular floor pushups because they hurt my wrists, so I’ve been using a bar and in the past I’ve used my fists. 

I would love to hear any tips/ advice, but my main question is how pushups everyday will interfere/ affect with needed muscle rest for growth with other workouts.

I cant gain more weight no matter how much i eat.,,0,I cant gain more weight no matter how much i eat.
Is it possible I gained about 1-1.5 kilos of mainly muscle over a period of 3-4 months?,"I am a 22M 5'11"". I have been following a modified version of the RR for the last 1.5 years. Started sometime around August 2020. About 3-4 months ago, I was too weak to do pull ups. At this point, only a specific part of my tricep was muscle-y (don't know how else to describe it). I also lost around 10 kilos in the process along with diet since I was overweight. I decided to maintain once I was around 71 kilos in May 2021. I measure my weight around twice a month.

Until 3-4 months ago I used to weigh around 70.5-71.5. Around this time, I discovered I can do pull ups with somewhat correct form so decided to add it to my routine. I am seeing drastic change in my arms. Almost my entire arm feels muscle-y and it's visually bigger when I flex even on my rest days. I also weight aroung 73 kilos now.

I have been following a modified version of the RR for the last 1.5 years. Started sometime around August 2020. About 3-4 months ago, I was too weak to do pull ups. At this point, only a specific part of my tricep was muscle-y (don't know how else to describe it). I also lost around 10 kilos in the process along with diet since I was overweight. I decided to maintain once I was around 71 kilos in May 2021. I measure my weight around twice a month.

Until 3-4 months ago I used to weigh around 70.5-71.5. Around this time, I discovered I can do pull ups with somewhat correct form so decided to add it to my routine. I am seeing drastic change in my arms. Almost my entire arm feels muscle-y and it's visually bigger when I flex even on my rest days. I also weight aroung 73 kilos now.

Diamond handstand pushups off the wall?,"Anyone here train these often or at all? I've been trying to build up to multiple 5 rep sets but it's been tough. My goal is to push for 8 rep sets in the hopes of building more triceps mass off them. 

So far my template for this has been starting with a wider hand base and moving about 3"" closer every time i hit my target rep/set range. I recently got 3 sets of 6 at 6"" apart. Moved to 3"" apart and got some 4s in. However the jump to touching was harder than expected so I'll probably go back to 6"" apart to hit 8 reps/set and then back to 3"" again to try the same.

How do I develop unilateral leg balancing strength?,"I love doing single leg loaded squats on some sort of platform(so not exactly a pistol)

Problem is, my left leg is super weak at balancing, so once I start loading close to my 1RM, I have a hard time keeping balance.

Interestingly, my left hip is far more flexible, when it comes to stretches like the figure four yoga position. My left hamstring is also more flexible.

Build muscle or lose weight?,"I am 47 and I’ve been doing the RR for 10 weeks now.

Ive been able to make good progression. When I started i thought id never get a pull-up, but I’ve gone from barely able to do scapular holds to 3x8 band assisted pullups in 10 weeks (I’ve made good progression on every exercise so far). I give a lot to the workout, I’m almost always struggling to get to my feet after the third pair of exercises. 

I’m 185 cm and 88kg (190 lb or so ) and Ive been eating 3,400 calories a day (my TDEE is 3,100). 

I just bought a digital scale (Withings) and it tells me that i have 23% body fat. I know that this may not be accurate, i could be 19-27%. However, my eyes agree, i can see lots of definition starting to show in my chest and shoulders, but i still have a belly.

What’s my best path forward if i want to look better? Should i 

1. Stick with the RR and eat 3,400 and hope the fat burns and muscle grows?
2. Add some cardio to burn more fat (leaving me more tired/time poor)
3. Eat at 3,100 and continue RR
4. Eat at 2,700 and continue RR

I know that every person is different, so I’m looking for any general recommendations.

Feeling like my (lower) abs are lagging,"It’s been about 5 months since I started training with my bodyweight and since this post is about my abs and core strength, I’m gonna focus on that. Just to give a little background: Starting out I could barely do leg raises and I couldn’t hold my lower back to the ground (initiating pelvic tilt). HOWEVER, I’ve improved a lot since then and I haven’t really felt the need to max out on leg raises on the ground as I do them hanging or on parallel bars. The problem is, I never really feel like my lower abs are working as hard as my upper, for example, after a 30s L-sit I will feel my upper abs “burning” and being much harder but feeling nearly nothing in my lower. I think this is probably related to genetics and that my body might store more fat in my lower abdomen since they also differ in definition. Any advice?

Weighted Chin Up Program/Routine?,"Would like to know if there are any time proven weighted chin up programs. I treat them as a main lift, much like a powerlifter would with SBD. 

I’ve used the conjugate method with chin ups, being 1 dynamic effort day and 1 max effort day and it seemed to have worked quite well in terms of increasing my totals. However, once I stopped running it, I have since lost strength on my chin ups. My bodyweight hasn’t fluctuated that much, only by a few pounds so that wasn’t the issue. I’ve tried mixing grips while using conjugate and that was pretty effective. 

Because of this, I’m going to start conjugate again, but would like to know if there are any programs/routines that are effective. I’ve tried searching but honestly haven’t found programs that specialize in this exercise, which is a shame.

Has anyone here returned back to weightlifting since the pandemic ended? What do you think about body weight fitness vs weight lifting now?,"Before the pandemic I did not work out. 

During the pandemic I wanted to get fit and started body weight fitness (also used bands). I made definite progress in the hypertrophy department but eventually hit a peak. I ended up buying a squat rack for my home and started lifting weights. Of course, I made a lot more progress in the hypertrophy department this way.

I have navigated away from body weight fitness and exclusively do weightlifting. The sole reason I have is that I get more hypertrophy results faster with weight lifting. I know I could have continued to do both, but the novelty of exercising has kind of gone away, so I just want to minimize the time I spend on it.

Hollow body ring dips —&gt; RTO dips,"Hello all,

I’ve been trying to nail down my ring dip proficiency by trying all sorts of variations. Recently someone suggested to try hollow body dips to improve shoulder strength. I started to incorporate these into my push days. I had a tendency to let the ring turn in on the eccentric so I’ve been making a conscious effort to keep them mostly parallel and to improve my ROM at the bottom position. Currently I’m at 5x6 looking to get 5x8 of these:

Older and broken. Looking for what works,"Hey all, 

I'm 43 and have a bad back, hips and knees. I'm in some form of pain virtually every day.

Benefits of “Elbow dips”?,"When I looked this up I saw something called Russian dips but they aren’t quite the variant I’ve been trying out, but I was doing them all day at work since they wasn’t anything to do and my chest and triceps feel sore and they haven’t felt sore since I started doing regular dips.

The variation I saw was like starting with elbows and turn into a regular dip, but what I’m doing is literally pushing myself up and down with my elbows. There’s less range of motion but I feel it may be hitting certain areas regular dips don’t. Does anyone try something like this and if you do how beneficial you think it is compared to regular dips?",0,"Benefits of “Elbow dips”?When I looked this up I saw something called Russian dips but they aren’t quite the variant I’ve been trying out, but I was doing them all day at work since they wasn’t anything to do and my chest and triceps feel sore and they haven’t felt sore since I started doing regular dips.

Progression stage and goal setting for jumping rope,"I used to go for jogs but recently was forced to do my cardio in my apartment, so I started skipping rope. I do it for 40 seconds and take a 20 second break for a total of 15 minutes. Thats about as much time I can spare. I got it up to 45 seconds with 15 second breaks. Also i still trip up frequently since I've never done this before.

Right now I'm struggling with trying to figure out how to challenge myself and what kind of goals I need to set for myself. I see people do all those fancy double jumps and crossing sides and one legging it or whatever. I want some kind of a progression plan so I can challenge myself and keep progressing constantly and get to that stage myself. Like how long should you be able to skip for continuously without taking a break to be ""good at it"".

Hair Growth,"Hi everyone. First post here, if I make any mistakes please let me know I’ll correct.

I got in touch with a professional trainer and a dietitian who has helped with me a routine for workout, defined macros for hitting the calorie intake and we also track progress each day and have weekly/ biweekly calls and discussion.

Given my previous very poor food intake abs habits I’ve cut on all junk and I’m eating healthy, sugar is almost absent in my diet and also no gluten.

What has really been a very prominent difference apart from losing body fat, is my hair.

I have very thin hair and my scalp was almost visible due to hair fall. I’ve been battling hair loss since I was 19, but just 8 weeks of eating good, getting enough sleep and maintaining my routine, today I took images for comparison purposes: the result was just so shocking and surprising. I was bummed!!

I felt like sharing my unaccounted and unexpected hair recovery. 

Apart from diet I have a multivitamin pill everyday, omega-3 pill at night and vitamin D pill once every week. I had high blood pressure, cholesterol and other health ailments at just 28.

What’s everyone’s thoughts on bracing inwards vs outwards?,"As a lot of us have no doubt seen there was a big drive on bracing inwards or exhaling completely whilst ab training to avoid ‘bread loaf abs’.

Personally I’ve found that if I spend a good amount of time fully expanding my belly or bracing outwards I actually have this great core activation, especially the obliques. 

I get why you need to exhale to get a great flexion and crunch of the rectus abdominis but could some of us need to train our abs in more of an extended position?

Exhale, flexion and crunch definitely trains the abs. 

But could an inhale and brace train the abs in a more functional way, especially for those with poor posture. 

Anecdotally, dedicated ab workouts with more flexion based exercises and that cinched aesthetic after makes me feel a lot less stable than bracing and non cinched ab workouts. 

Feel like I subconsciously tighten my stomach in everyday life which restricts my breathing. 

Spending half hour focusing on expansion and tensing my abs definitely helps my posture.

Those that subconsciously hold in their stomach are likely compensating for a weak overall core, IE weak glutes or hamstrings at the base of the core. Lower abs and stomach tightens inwards to compensate restricts the diaphragm from moving optimally therefore this laboured shallow and rapid chest breathing that many of us have.

Routine check,"Hi gang,

**Some initial FYIs**

• I’m focusing a lot on lower body mobility; my hips are incredibly restricted when it comes to tilting for the pancake/forward fold, hence all the pancake work (mostly hinge work). All of this mobility also includes PNF hence no other specific leg work

"How to make a daily sustainable routine? (Running, Stretching and Bodyweight Training)","Hey guys - I need some advice.   


I'm trying to work on building a functional and broad base of fitness. I've started running every day, but only about 2.5km for the first two weeks and will likely add 500m per fortnight until I reach around 6-7km a day. Along side this however, I'm finding that I finish my run in a park and I still have a bit of time and energy to fit in some resistance training. So;

I want to know if there is some sort of basic full body workout routine that I could repeat, perhaps Monday-Friday mornings after my run, that would give me a basic level of strength. At the moment i'm doing: 

1. Super set of pushups, Australian pullups, and squats - 3x set to 80% capacity (perhaps 12-15 reps each).
2. Super set of chin ups, hanging oblique raises, single leg kickbacks and incline tricep pushup - 2x sets at 70% capacity (perhaps 3-6 chin ups, 5 oblique raises and 10 kickbacks each side).
3. 2-3 minutes of core - V sits, hollow body holds, crunches etc.

I would really love some advice on things i could change or perhaps add to get a more rounded training program. Ideally I'd love to do the same or a similar workout every day along with a run. I travel a lot, and have a pretty varied schedule so I would love something I could just get up in the morning and smash out before my day starts.

I appreciate any advice that anyone can throw my way, or even if anyone could point me in the right direction on where to read more about this.

How do I deal with psychological exhaustion and hatred of exercise?,"10 minutes ago, I started doing my leg workout. I finished the first set, took a break, and went to do the second set.

I was doing pistol squats on my left leg when my brain simply had too much of it. I lowered myself for the 5th rep, said: ""Fuck it"", and quit.

I didn't quit because my muscles were burning or achieved failure. I gave up because I was tired psychologically. 

For the past two weeks, my rapid progress in all of my leg exercises has finally stopped. I couldn't progressively overload myself for 4 leg workouts in a row (I do PPL split). 

You have no idea how much dread and fear I experience before the leg day. I'm afraid of the pain I'm going to suffer. I'm afraid of the discomfort and occasional burning feeling in my muscles. I'm afraid of regressing or not being able to hit the prescribed amount of repetitions.

I waste my evening trying to find a solution to this issue, to discover someone who has had the same problem and fixed it. 

Additionally, I've been seriously considering taking a full week off training. The last time I did that that was one year ago for legs and six months ago for arms. 

I'm sure that if I don't make my training more enjoyable, I risk quitting all of this altogether. Can you help me? Would it be the right thing to take a small break? Do you perceive the same emotions as I do before a gruelling workout?

P.S. I've been training since the age of 8 (I'm 15, now).

I can probably count on my fingers how many times I've missed a workout in the last three years.

Going into a dead hang on weighed pullups?,"So I've recently been training weighted pullups, and I'm curious about what I should be doing. With normal pullups, I always start from a dead hang, explode up, hold at the top for a second and then lower slowly back into a dead hang, then repeat. Ive had no issues doing them like this and will probably continue this way for unweighted pullups.

Now for weighted pullups, I want to train these for max strength so sub 5 reps. I was unsure as to how to do the rep. Of course I will start in a dead hang, but when lowering is it safe to go into a dead hang with external load? Or would I be safer lowering until my arms are extended but while still maintaining scapular depression in an active hang. This is how I currently perform them. Of course I would like to go back into a dead hang and pull from there like I do with unweighted pullups, however my main concern is that over time will this damage my joints or the structures in my shoulders or elbows etc?

Any help/advice regarding this is much appreciated!!",0,"Going into a dead hang on weighed pullups?So I've recently been training weighted pullups, and I'm curious about what I should be doing. With normal pullups, I always start from a dead hang, explode up, hold at the top for a second and then lower slowly back into a dead hang, then repeat. Ive had no issues doing them like this and will probably continue this way for unweighted pullups.

Now for weighted pullups, I want to train these for max strength so sub 5 reps. I was unsure as to how to do the rep. Of course I will start in a dead hang, but when lowering is it safe to go into a dead hang with external load? Or would I be safer lowering until my arms are extended but while still maintaining scapular depression in an active hang. This is how I currently perform them.

What calisthenic oriented workout (along with some weights) do you guys recommend or use?,"1) for those who have built decent muscles and size (not necessarily bodybuilder style muscles) what are some good calisthenics routines? Keep in mind I also have set of dumbbells with adjustable weights so I don't mind those being added to routine.

2) what are some warm ups for calisthenics oriented exercises?

Equipment I have at home:

Adjustable dumbbells that go up to 12 kg. Each plate on the dumbbell can come off and weights 1.5-2.5 kg. I also have one metal dumbbell that weights 25 pounds. 

Dip and pull up station.

Resistance band for assisted dips or pull ups (although I don't use it much but I felt if it helps with the form then why not). 

Might soon also purchases a weighted vest. 

I am starting to get back into my workout (used to workout 3-4 times a week) but I haven't been for a few months. I would appreciate tips and tricks for working out. Is there any other equipment u guys recommend I invest in?

Small pro-tip for additional bicep/core work: hold @ the top of the chinup.,"One of my overall issues with BWF is what I feel is a lack of bicep work. After trying out some curls following a set of chinups to failure, it became very clear to me that for the purpose of aesthetics, bar work alone wouldn't be enough. 

I'm now doing something a little extra on the final or near-final rep of my narrow-grip chinups (I stopped doing pullups a long while back); I hold my position well above the bar. In doing this, I feel a clear emphasis on biceps/core putting in more work, and as a result I was not able to do as many curls afterwards.

Should I change the order of my exercises?,"Hello everyone!
I started working out a couple of months ago at home, training in a PPL routine 6 days a week.

On push day I do 6 sets of pushups, 3 of them with added weight in a backpack, followed up by 3 sets DB presses, 3 sets of Flys, 4 sets of OHP and 3 sets of Triceps Dips.

First of I wanted to ask if this is enough to build muscle, i do this workout 2x a week. I‘m a beginner, weight 68kg at 185cm. (19 / male)

My Problem:

I noticed that my DB press really suffers when I do it after the pushups, I can almost double the reps if I do DB press first, but if I do it first I‘m barely able to do Pushups afterwards, no weighted Pushups.

For building muscle, should I do the DB presses or pushups first? Does it even matter or am I allowed to switch up the order based on my liking on that day? 

I hope its okay I‘m asking this question here, because I‘m including Dumbbells…

Sorry if this question is dumb and I‘m just overthinking, I just feel like there is so many things that can „ruin your gains“ according to YouTube, litteraly drives me crazy.

Decline push-ups instead of regular push-ups ?,"Hello, i have a question. I train calisthenics for like year now, i was training with weights in the gym before. I dont train for skills, but for hypertrophy/strenght, so im progressing by adding weight. I follow PPL split and i personally like less exercises with higher volume (so 1 variation of vertical pull, 1 variation of horizontal etc.). Same for my push-day, i do 1x dips and 1x push-ups. The thing is, as i said i train mainly for hypertrophy, so with just dips and regular push-ups i will definitely grow good chest, but im just missing those incline benches from gym for upper chest ( i mean every muscle building program has incline pushing).

With calisthenics, for upper chest pushing, there are decline push-ups. Some people say its upper chest exercise like incline dumbell press for example, some say its harder variation of regular push-ups, some say they completely sucks because shoulders and triceps are heavily activated and you get almost simillar upper chest activation with regular push-ups.

I tried them and i feel like they are more ""compound"" and just less isolating than incline presses, but they are still target that upper chest little bit more than regular push-ups i guess. 

So my question is, do you think i can do dips+decline push-ups on PUSH day, could i do decline push-ups completely instead of regular ones, or the upper chest activation is not that big with decline a i will be better with sticking to regular push-ups ?

Question on r/bodyweightfitness apps,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going back to bodyweight fitness and this sub after a few years. I am using the old Android [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bodyweight.fitness.free), that is also featured in the FAQ. In it, there is the recommended routine and two extra flexibility/care routines, and I had a few questions:

* Is the in-app recommended routine equivalent to the one in the reddit section 'Routines'? I see the 'old' one in the app, with bodyline drills into the progressions like Handstand, instead of the 'newer' pairs and the tripet approach.
* Where can I find the videos for the 'Stretching routine' of the app? The videos won't open when I click (it opens youtube but no video is selected)

And overall, would you use another app or routine? What I like of the app is that it tracks progress so I'd like to pick an option that is maintained or has continuity, otherwise it doesn't make much sense.

Which is the best Pike Push-up form?,"[https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy](https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy) (me trying to replicate the different forms of Pike push-up that I'm talking about)  


Hey there, this is kind of an exploratory/debate post where I would like to have your opinion and experience on the topic of pike push-up form. My main intent behind this post is to understand which approach is best for strength gains and transferability towards skills like HSPU and bent-arm presses. Every single tutorial on the pike push-up has a slightly different approach and gives different form cues, even when leaving aside the plain bad ones (wrt calisthenics transferability at least) like ""elbows flared out/head touching the ground between the hands/purely vertical plane of motion"" (as in [this picture](https://www.google.com/search?q=pike+push+up&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5jtjC5J_1AhUWQEEAHQM2BFUQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=942&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=M0qjGb6MgOivNM)). Even among the main well-recognized calisthenics influencers, there are significant disparities on the topic of pike push-ups.

# The different forms

I think there are mainly 2 approaches, although there is a whole spectrum between these two ""extremes"". These approaches seem to agree on what the top-part of the ROM should be (elevating the shoulders as much as possible, tucking the head between the shoulders, as shown in picture A), but differ in the lower part of the ROM.

\- The first one (depicted in picture B) advocates for a diagonal movement, where the goal is to touch the ground with the nose very far forward in front the hands in order to increase the ROM. This is the form promoted for instance by Antranik in [this detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/b2z06d/pike_pushups_are_an_excellent_progression/). With this form, it is considered that some arching in the back is OK, since it would be very hard to maintain a perfect posterior pelvic tilt and hollow body in this position.

\- The second one (depicted in picture C) advocates for a movement that is closer to vertical, where the goal is to lower the head until the forehead or top of the head touches the ground and forms a \~equilateral triangle with the hands. Examples of influencers promoting this technique are FitnessFAQs (for instance in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yLcLmhhjDw) from 1:35 on), SaturnoMovement ([in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cT6ug3WVn4)), Tom Merrick ([here from 3:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdEOdHGt9HY)). A particular emphasis is placed on maintaining a Posterior pelvic tilt, and preventing any kind of arching in the back. Another cue that is given in some of these videos is to purposefully shift as much of your weight as possible on your hands from the very beginning of the motion, only tipping as lightly as possible on your toes.

\- An example of an in-between approach would be that proposed by Yaad Mohammad in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQhrk6WMcKw) from 6:40 on: he touches the ground with his nose, but not too far forward, and insists on keeping a hollow body (which I tried to replicate in picture D).

# My experience

I've experimented with these different forms in the past several months (on the grind for the frog-to-handstand), and my feeling so far has been the following: I found the second, more vertical form noticeably harder than the first one (with all other parameters equal: elevation of the feet, distance from feet to hands), and felt a stronger load on my shoulders, whereas I feel like the first form somewhat offloads the shoulders in favor of the upper pecs in the lower range of motion (probably due to its slight resemblance to pseudo-planche push-ups). I've noticed that trying to touch the ground with my nose instead of my forehead induces some arching in my back, which seems to make the movement a bit easier as well, despite the increased ROM. In my experience, the ""shift your weight on your hands"" cue makes the exercise significantly harder, and when your feet are close enough to your hands, they should almost be able to lift off the ground when at the bottom of the ROM.

I'm still not anywhere close to getting a full HSPU or bent-arm press, so I didn't want to draw conclusions based on my experience alone. Which is why I would like to hear your opinion!

# What is your opinion?

1. Which form has the best carry-over to skills like handstand push-ups and bent-arm presses?
2. From an anatomical/biomechanical perspective, what makes the second form harder than the first one?

PS: I know that this post is kind-of nitpicking, and that just getting the reps in is more important than debating endlessly about form, but still I really like learning more about the theory and the anatomy/biomechanics around calisthenics!",0,"Which is the best Pike Push-up form?[ (me trying to replicate the different forms of Pike push-up that I'm talking about)

How can I incorporate bricks as weights in the RR?,"So, I don't have any gym equipments like dumbbells, barbells, weights anything... But i got bricks. Lots of them. And bags too.

So, my question is how do I effectively incorporate them into the RR? The bricks weigh about 2-3kgs each.
_____________________________
I dunno if anybody would be interested in reading so you can skip it but the thing is i have always been skinny (106lb/49kg at 5'6) and i hate it. Being insulted by kids in schools, relatives and even my own dad sometimes. 
And i overall have a very weak personality. 

So, i have finally decided to take control of things and have decided that i want to make improvements to my physique as much as possible in the next 3 months as by then i will pass on to a higher class and want to make a good first impression.

I have read the FAQs and i overall have an idea of what to do (except for the bricks) I have finished the bwf primer, added more calories to my diet (600-1000) by eating 3 bowls of about 200 calories of of nuts&amp;pb throughout the day and i am also trying to add some sprouts/lentils too for more calories and protein.

Since my final exams (*very important*) are also coming and the fact that my sister is like a national level topper in that exam so I also have a lot of expectations and pressure on me too. I feel like when I exercise i feel very relieved and it clears my mind. 

I know this part became a bit ranty so sorry for that.

I'm working my way up to rings weighted pushup, following this video : [ by fitnessfaq. He mentions that the weight belt shoud be placed on the midback, but mine just keep lowering itself to my lower back as soon as I attach the weight.

How do maintain the weight belt on your midback? I'm sure other have and will run into this issue before, so that's why I'm creating my own thread rather than asking in the daily question thread.

Thank you !

"Is it possible to achieve this kind of physique (meaning this level of muscle mass) only with bodyweight excercises (mainly push ups, dips, pull ups, rows, none of them weighted)?","I was wondering if it’s possible to achieve a look like that with bodyweight excercises, and I mean without performing them weighted but just bodyweight, more like a prison workout. https://i.imgur.com/gN4x7mr.jpg

Of course in this particular case, a clean diet is essential, I’m aware of that.

All in all, he seems to have a pretty good chest, decent arms and possibly a lagging back, so my main doubt is that dips and push ups can give you that kind of chest.

I was thinking of something like that:

Chest: push ups (incline, wide, ring pushups), dips, ring flies

Back: pull ups (regular, neutral, wide, chin ups, narrow chin ups), rows (regular rows, wide rows, ring rows)

Shoulders: already working with pull ups, push ups and dips. Maybe lateral raises and facepulls

Arms: already working with chest and back excercises. Maybe ring curls and diamond push ups once a week

Legs: squats, deadlifts, pistol squats

Please help me to split the RR into a 6/1 workout,"First of all, a big thank you to this inspiring community for all the valuable information you've consistently been putting out there. I've been a lurker here for years!

Has anybody here successfully split the recommended routine?

I'm looking for ideas to reduce the time per workout while still maintaining the total workload. My goal is to work out 6 days a week for about 30 minutes each (excluding warm-up). All information I could find was referencing the old RR.

**So the goal would be to end up with something like this:**

* Mo: A
* Tue: B
* Wed: A
* Thu: B
* Fr: A
* Sat: B
* Sun: Rest

I know it's not ideal to split the recommended routine but a non-ideal workout is better than none and I found it easier to stick to it if I maintain momentum.

**At the moment, my workout looks like this:**

* Bulgarian Split Squad
* Chin Ups
* Bench Dips
* Banded Nordic Curls
* Inverted Row
* Push-Ups
* Ab Wheel
* Pallof Press
* Back extensions

Questions about weighted bodyweight exercises..,"So I've come across some posts where people have mentioned doing weighted push ups, pull ups, dips, etc.

I was going to try this out but I am a little confused as to how you know when to switch from just your bodyweight to added weight? Is there a magic set/rep number that you reach and if there is how do you know what that number would be?

For example, if I can do 5 sets of 25 push ups without fail.. someone might say to add weight. So my other question would be what would be the difference between adding a few more push ups to each set vs adding weight? Is the addition of weight for the sake of time/efficiency? Or could you get the same results by adding more reps?

I'm not against the idea just looking for better information on it is all.",0,"Questions about weighted bodyweight exercises..So I've come across some posts where people have mentioned doing weighted push ups, pull ups, dips, etc.

When I started years ago I did zero cardio. That was fine, but at some point I started to look like a powerlifter, wasn't really what I was going for... so I started doing all that cardio.

Chin ups as a progression to pull ups?,"Hi all,

I've been trying to transition to more bodyweight workouts over the last 6 months. I've been doing 5x5 to build up a decent base for about 6 months before that, but I'm fairly weak in the shoulders and back due to an old lumbar injury. I can't do a single pull up unassisted but I can do 2 - 3 chin ups.

And I notice down the bottom the poster says either pullups or chinups will do. I just wanted to get some opinions on whether or not it would be a good idea for me to just focus on doing chin ups as a way to transition into pullups down the line? I'm thinking of doing them a minimum 3 times a week, aware of the fact that I don't want to injure myself.

Any feedback would be great.

"Recommendation for bodyweight, dumbbell only? &lt; 30 minutes","29M, 180 lbs

I'm someone who exercises 3 times a week, but I really just do exercises that I find here and there for 20 mins at a pace that gets my muscles exhausted, gets the heart pumping, and breaks a sweat. I found one in the sidebar that I'd been doing a while:  pushups, lunges, rows, shoulder taps. Is this still considered a decent quick body routine? I'll sometimes switch this up and throw in more abs or arms exercises.

Anyways, I have access to 2 Bowflex dumbbells that I can vary the weight on. I'm looking for a routine that uses only bodyweight and the dumbbells so that I can workout from my apartment. I'm also willing to get resistance bands.

My primary goals are to overall look and be fit, strengthen muscles joints to support sedentary work life and hobbies, and build foundation so that I'm not hurting when I'm older. I guess I appear fit enough, but I'm not necessarily gaining muscle, which is fine as long as I'm healthy.

Generally my questions are...
1) Is my current routine good enough to support my goals?

Strength going up but not endurance,"Hello, I've been seeing strength gains in my pullups and dips, but it's not helping me with endurance at lower weight. For instance I started doing dips with 35 lbs a few months ago I would be able to 7-8 in a row but in the next set I could only do 4-5 sets. I assumed the problem was my strength so I started doing more strength training, and stopped hypertrophy training for approximately 2 months. My 1 rep max now on dips is 95lbs and 40lbs with pullups. However im going back to the lighter weight and still hitting the same reps. The funny thing is though the lighter weight does indeed feel alot lighter then it used to, but my endurance hasn't changed at all. Do any of you know what's wrong, I know alot of solutions, but I can't find a solution for this problem at all. If you know what I can do to fix this please let me know.",0,"Strength going up but not enduranceHello, I've been seeing strength gains in my pullups and dips, but it's not helping me with endurance at lower weight. For instance I started doing dips with 35 lbs a few months ago I would be able to 7-8 in a row but in the next set I could only do 4-5 sets. I assumed the problem was my strength so I started doing more strength training, and stopped hypertrophy training for approximately 2 months. My 1 rep max now on dips is 95lbs and 40lbs with pullups. However im going back to the lighter weight and still hitting the same reps. The funny thing is though the lighter weight does indeed feel alot lighter then it used to, but my endurance hasn't changed at all. Do any of you know what's wrong, I know alot of solutions, but I can't find a solution for this problem at all. If you know what I can do to fix this please let me know."
Am I doing calisthenics right?,"I’ve been bodybuilding for 5 years. Progress was slow but sure. I live in Ontario Canada, where the gyms are closed now and will continue to close. While always wanting to start calisthenics but being scared of starting from scratch, I haven’t done calisthenics till now. My arms are a weak point for my physique but my chest is a strong point. After my first week training calisthenics my arms and core is in agony (good sore) but I don’t feel much in my chest. I training Monday-Friday and rest the weekends (this is best for me). I have been doing 

Monday: push (HSPU, deep dips, jumping muscle ups, and tricep extensions because my goal is a Russian dip. Then I do pike push ups, archer push ups, and idk what else yet)

Tuesday: legs (I have weights and a squat rack so I do back squats, front squats, Bulgarians, knee extensions, and hip thrusts)

Wednesday: pull (this is my biggest problem, my pulling strength isn’t the best, so I do pull ups but eccentric on opposite sides, normal pull ups superset with banded pull-ups, I tried to do assisted headbangers, and supinated rows (completely horizontal)

Thursday: legs (same as Tuesday 

Friday: push/pull fundamentals (pike push-ups, weighted deep dips, archer push ups, weighted pull ups, some sort of row and leg raises, now my problem is that I wanted to still grow my muscles so I was going to incorporate incline DB press, skull crushers and shoulder press)

Sorry it’s so long I desperately need help. My goal is be in the best shape of my life (I realized I neglected muscles doing weight training by the soreness)

-I want to maintain the muscles I have and grow the muscles I don’t
-I want to build up to the point where I can incorporate advanced movements to maximize muscle growth (Russian dips and headbangers)

Negative pull ups as a bigger person,"I’ve just bought a pull up bar and just tried negative pull ups for the first time, hasn’t gone well.
I’ve found that I can barely hold for one second and it gets worse.
How long should I be able to hold for it to be productive as a goal? E.g don’t bother if you can do less than 5 seconds or something?
Given how short my holds are while I am cutting weight I may try to use resistance bands to help me with either negatives or just pull ups depending how much they help me but I am wondering when it is worth to stop using resistance bands? Also if anyone has any tips for someone bigger trying to build up for pull ups that is also massively appreciated.",0,"Negative pull ups as a bigger personI’ve just bought a pull up bar and just tried negative pull ups for the first time, hasn’t gone well.

Can fortified cereal be a viable alternative to a multi vitamin?,"so I have been struggling to find a good alternative to a multivitamin pill.

I know it's not a huge deal but I really don't like pills of any kind and I would much prefer to just eat my nutrients.

but after a bit of research I've come to the conclusion fortified cereal with the addition of fortified milk will probably be the best alternative for me.

But I am not an expert in this field and I was just wondering if fortified cereal is good enough to replace a multivitamin pill.

I'm not really interested in losing weight at the moment if anything I'm looking to gain weight so I don't really care about the calories.

I don't really have any cereal in mind just as long as it is fortified.

Additionally I am 6'2 and 220 pounds  at and I imagine I would have to eat a lot of cereal to compensate for my body weight.

Gtg update on the burpees x pull up circuit,"I noticed why the jogging in between burpees is essential.  Because normally we don't really pay attention to the calves.  Doing it this way gives the calves some work.

Also the gtg style of it can make you do 27+ sets throughout the day.  Hehe feels fantastic if you have time to do it. else the 8 sets a day is enough.

Breath work and stretching helps with recovery.

Weird thing is my bodyfat seems to fluctuate, which I believe it's just because the error of skin calipers.  So roughly 14%+.

Then the peanut butter really helped as my workout supplement. Hehe

Another thing I've noticed, is low intensity lot of volume actually made me stronger.  I was able to climb the monkey bars with little issue.  And finally,

Thinking of a way to make use of low intensity lot of volume for other exercises.  Probably bands whole body workout.

Calisthenics as a heavier person.,"Hello, 

Just joined this community, and started the RR a couple of weeks ago! 

I am 5'8, 190 lbs (\~86kg) --&gt; when I was lighter, I was easily able to do pushups and some pull-ups, but obvioiusly that isn't the case now. Even though I'm overweight, I'm having a good time and progressing decently well! 

This is a total beginner question, but I haven't had any luck in seeing it answered. 

I know that if you weigh more, calisthenics is tougher, especially the deeper you go, and your progress will be slower. While I'm totally fine with that - woudn't me being a heavier weight be..helpful? Now I know that's a dumb question but I'm not sure why that isn't the case. Wouldn't I get stronger if I start doing pullups at 185-190 lbs vs 150-155 lbs? I know that isn't correct, but would love it if someone could help me out.

"My 58 years old mom wants to start exercising slowly, where to begin?","Hey! My mom just turned 58, shes still pretty healthy and walks atleast 30-40 minutes 5 days a week (walks home from work every day). And sometimes longer walks on the weekends. She is not obese or severely overweight, just some extra lbs and some excess belly fat which obviously not great. And she has not lifted weights (ever) or had any form of resistance training in many many years.

She has gained some weight in the last few years and would like to lose some. I've calculated her macros and will help her plan her meals and learn to count calories somewhat as I am still living at home for another 6 months before going to Uni after the summer, I'll make sure she gets some more protein aswell! Hopefully I can get her started abit while I'm still at home. She asked me for tips, or if we could start slowly every weekend with some bodyweight exercises together both for health and for bonding time.

I am not quite sure where to start? Before doing any added weights I'll tell her the importance that we go get a clear from a doctor first which I would recomend anyone at any age. I assume some cardio, and the regular push pull and leg/hinge exercise is beneficial at any age? Like pushups (starting easy against a table or wall). Maybe getting up from a chair in the start and transitioning into squats/lunges, and maybe some row movement? Other than that I was thinking some yoga or just light stretching. But I would really love some tips or guidance from anyone with more experience, I only started exercising regularly a couple years ago myself but have been doing pretty well myself, however I am in my 20's and I assume it's quite different?

I have built like a mini gym at home during Covid, we have access to dumbells, a barbell, squatting rack, bench, resistance bands, pilates ball and yoga mats, and a pull up bar.

Is there anything I should avoid? Or any signs that we should move onto something else, and some things to keep in mind, like soreness not going away after a few days?

Reps or Sets?,"I've been doing casual calisthenics for a while now, almost a year, but i came to a point where i'm no longer able to progressively do more reps.

That lead me to think what might be wrong, and considering that my diet is not that bad and i really try my best in each workout, i thought it may be happening because i focus too much in the first set, so, would it be better if i even out my sets and do the same amount of reps in each one?",0,"Reps or Sets?I've been doing casual calisthenics for a while now, almost a year, but i came to a point where i'm no longer able to progressively do more reps.

Unequal leg strength?,"Hi all,
I’ve been training calisthenics for about 8 months now, around 6 on some version of the RR (currently doing upper/lower split so I can do more leg volume, but I still generally do 3 on each a week). I’ve been working pistol squats for about a month now and I’m noticing a pretty significant strength imbalance between my two legs on these. 

For example, I can do 5-6 unassisted (or maybe very light assistance towards the end) on my left leg. On my right, I can do maybe one unassisted on the first set but pretty much all subsequent reps/sets, I need at least a partial assist to get back up from the bottom.

I’m not sure if it’s a mobility/ankle strength issue maybe, although I am able to hit full range of motion on both legs even if I can’t get up from it unassisted on the right. I don’t think flexibility is a huge issue though—I’ve always been quite flexible.

Any help/suggestions are much appreciated, thank you!",0,"Unequal leg strength?Hi all,

Goals for 2022,"This year I hope to keep training strength consistently. As a realistic goal I'm going to hold myself to at least two workouts a week. I lead a really active lifestyle and have a weird work schedule so keeping a good workout schedule is difficult.

I've not been too interested in skills work until recently. I think it would be a good motivator to try to finally get some cool skills down that I've neglected. This year I want to achieve a consistent press handstand. My main obstacle here is going to hamstring flexibility. I've always struggled so much with my flexibility. If I don't consistently stretch I literally cannot touch my toes or hold my legs straight out in front of me, for instance in an L-Sit pull up (which is an exercise I love but always do with knees bent). So mini-goal is hamstring flexibility and mega-goal is press handstand. I don't quite have the shoulder strength but I love pushing and getting that part of the skill will be fun for me.

Next skill goal is a full front lever. I can tuck front lever for around 45 seconds at this point so I think with consistent training here I can achieve a solid few seconds of full front lever by the end of the year.

Finally I REALLY want to get a muscle up. I think I'm really close here. I can bang out deep ring dips and chest to bar pull ups with good form pretty well at this point. I've been trying to train the transition part of the muscle up but it's really a crux move still. I think I need to get a stronger false grip so I'm going to focus on that. I may also be looking to purchase weights for my dips and pull-ups. Anyone have recommendations for products? Should I get a vest or a belt with plates?

Hollow body neck engagement,"I've been gym training for 3 years. Although my muscles are developed I feel as though my core is lacking, which could be the cause of my shoulder and neck stiffness/tightness. Tried doing the hollow body hold multiple times and, especially when lifting off the ground I feel my neck, back and legs work way more than my core/abs. 

If I try to lift my legs and upper body off the ground STRICTLY using my abs/core and nothing else, my legs slightly raise and my upper body doesn't budge.

Apologies for the long build up, my question is - should my legs and upper body be completely relaxed during the hollow hold?

Tried doing the hollow body hold multiple times and, especially when lifting off the ground I feel my neck, back and legs work way more than my core/abs. 

If I try to lift my legs and upper body off the ground STRICTLY using my abs/core and nothing else, my legs slightly raise and my upper body doesn't budge.

Apologies for the long build up, my question is - should my legs and upper body be completely relaxed during the hollow hold? 
Thanks in advance"

Chinup ladders are a cheat code.,"Ill start this out by saying im an overthinker and my mind is usually the biggest obstacle to what i can lift. At the gym i was able to do 15 v bar chins, but everytime i had to lift at home all i had was a basic bar and i was doing like 12 rep sets that felt like complete trash. 

Right now i decided to try ladders, (1, 12, 123 etc) didnt do them exactly as written (very impatient person) but rather just counted my reps as 1, 12, 123 without letting go of the bar instead of counting normally. I just repped out 5 sets of 20 like it was nothing. And to think i was honestly considering doing rows. 

If anyone else out there shuts down when they get to what their mind perceives as a hard set you have to try this shit, probably even better if you do it with rest in between.",0,"Chinup ladders are a cheat code.Ill start this out by saying im an overthinker and my mind is usually the biggest obstacle to what i can lift.

Different variations in the same day or in different days?,"What's recommended for being proficient in the different variations of a given exercise? For example, there are pull ups, typewriter pull ups, archer pull ups, weighted pull ups and so on.

Obviously weighted pull ups are a better version of non weighted pull ups for strength. But what about Archer and Typewriter? How can incorporate them in my existing routine without making it longer or replacing other exercises?

The best setup for doing weighted push-up at home!,"Video: https://youtube.com/shorts/eXHiQ3b0QmU

To do this, you need a pair of straps. You can use martial art belts. I bought mine for 5 bucks. If you don't have a plate loader, you can just loop the strap through the weight plates.

Benefits of this setup:
* Allows you to go down as deep as you want.
* The weight hangs directly below your upper back and chest.
* Doesn't cause discomfort in your lower back.
* You can go extremely heavy without needing a spotter like with a bench press.

I have done reps with 65 kg of plates hanging off me like this. It's definitely the best way to go heavy on chest at home.",0,"The best setup for doing weighted push-up at home!Video:

Training when going through a hard time,"My family is going through a rough time at the moment between Covid and other health issues. Although I am thankfully healthy and well, I need to take care of others, especially my 8 year old nephew. On top of that work is not going well, which all adds up to a lot to deal with.

I have had to severely cut back what I do because I lack the energy and motivation to do more (staying at home because of Covid doesn't help) so I wanted to ask those that have undergone or are in tough situations how you manage to schedule your training.

Brachialis snaps/pops during heavy benching,"
Hey guys,

I have a little pops\snaps in my brachialis while benching. The pain is around above 60% of 1RM, happens only during a specific range of motion(just when bar is about to touch the chest). 
I can feel something pop/snap in the brachialis which makes me loose my tightness the bar comes and rest on my chest for a brief second and the I can press it up from there.
The pain continues in a few accessories as well like weighted dips, weighted pull ups, OHP. Other than these the pain goes away I can’t feel anything while doing hammer or anything else.
This pain has made me stick on my bench and ohp for like an year now.

I have tried everything, spot rolling using a lacrosse ball, percussion machine etc.

One arm pushup as a form of obliques training,"Hello everyone, my stats are as follows (so that this post isn’t removed): M 177cm/5’9.5 and 77kg/170lbs. I’ve been lifting weights for several years (been following a structured routine for only the last 1.5 years). I can do bodyweight +150lbs dips so I have a good amount of pushing strength and one arm pushups are not a challenge for my triceps or pecs.

The discussion I want to start comes from the observation that whenever I do one-arm pushups, I feel intense doms in my obliques the next day. This is obviously because of the intense strain on the obliques to prevent the body from twisting and collapsing during the movement. I haven’t felt this much strain on my obliques for any other movement despite training obliques consistently through other exercises such as woodchoppers, windshield wipers, and side planks.

My question is: does anyone have experience with performing one-arm pushups as an exercise to mainly train and induce hypertrophy in obliques? Or is there a similar bodyweight exercise that stresses the obliques as much? Right now, the only one that comes to my mind (apart from ridiculous moves like one arm front lever or planches) is the human flag.",0,"One arm pushup as a form of obliques trainingHello everyone, my stats are as follows (so that this post isn’t removed): M 177cm/5’9.5 and 77kg/170lbs.

My strength increased dramatically while being on 1000+ calorie deficit,"So i'm a 16 year old boy and i've been overweight for around 7 years. i decided to lose weight since november 2020 and it's been going pretty decent so far. I was 160 cm(5'2 ft) and 80 kg(177 lbs) when i first started, just plain overweight. And now i'm 165 cm(5'4 ft) with 60 kg(135 lbs). Until like 3 months ago, i only cared about  calories in n out with extreme 1300-1200 calories a day. Of course that led me to lose so much muscle and leaving me with a skinny fat look that i have now. I decided to just cut the calories super low again and lose weight(yes even muscle) because i tried to maintain/build muscle mass while losing fat at the same time and i found it really hard and just didn't work out for me. However, yesterday i checked my 1rm of chin-up cause i was just curios about it. Now i wasn't able to do a single chin up until i became 66 kg(146 lbs) which was 4 months ago. But yesterday, i was able to do full chin up while wearing a backpack filled with 25 kg(55 lbs) of stuff. I was heavier than i ever was with that backpack!(60+25=85 kg) even heavier than before i started losing weight. But there could be just one lame answer to that. So as i mentioned before, i tried to lose weight and build muscle at the same time with a reasonable 1800 calories a day and also calisthenics strength training 4-5 times a week. i did that about a month but there was just no visible change. so does that mean that 1 month of proper workout increased my strength that much without any physical change ? But that wasn't the only workout i threw in since the whole weight loss started. I been doing 100-200 pushups a day for 7-8 months till last september but it's hard to be called a proper workout. Because i didn't know anything about near failure, reps, sets so i've just been doing some pushups throughout the whole day so i doubt that did anything to my strength.

Build more muscle: Add weights to RR or switch routine?,"Hi everyone. Skinny 29yo here.  
I have been doing the (old) RR for some years. I do a sedentary day job so I've mostly used the routine to keep in shape and stay healthy, and it has mostly accomplished the job in that regard, but in these years I have built almost 0 muscle and I would like to change that.   
I know most of you are gonna say ""eat more"". Believe me, I have tried. No matter what, this is something that my body or brain refused to do.

I know most of you are going to tell me to eat more and believe me, it's not for a lack of trying. No matter how hard I try, my body/brain won't allow me to.

"Interesting discussion about ""fats make you fuller""","I was just watching one of my nutrition lectures, and I learned that for us to feel the sensation of being full and getting that 'satisfaction' after eating, leptin must be secreted for it to go to the hypothalamus and bind to the LEP-R receptors. Our body only then recognises this as 'yep that's enough food. We're good.'

I also learned that insulin stimulates both the synthesis and secretion of leptin. This has the following implication: we need a rise in blood sugar, so that insulin can get released -&gt; secrete a fair amount of leptin -&gt; feel full. On this idea, my lecturer said that ""fats making us fuller"" comes across as a misunderstanding for the most part. Whilst it could keep you full ***after*** you feel the initial 'fullness', but to *actually feel full in the first place,* fats are actually counteractive. This is because fats slow the digestion rate of both proteins and carbs (ie. agents who are capable of spiking blood sugar) and delays insulin secretion, and therefore leptin secretion as well.

And this led onto an important point for those following LCHF/keto approach; for those who don't track their calories and only just 'listen to their body', having such high intake of fat + very limited rise in blood sugar levels, they could actually PUT ON WEIGHT because they have harder time feeling full after they eat!

This was the main takeaway from the lecture though. Any ideas/counterarguments/supporting arguments? I know this sub can be biased towards outshining the benefits whilst neglecting its downsides, but I always like to evaluate the validity of my sources - even reliable ones like university lectures imo.

How to hang rings on ceiling joists?,"I bought a pair of rings during summer and have been using it outside for the time being. But now that it's winter and we're in a lockdown. I wanted to try and hang my rings in my basement.


I have these ceiling joists exposed but wasn't too sure what tools would need to be used and how they would be used to hang them.

Home Gym and Walking is a Great combination of Exercise," With the busy way of life today, a couple of adults with families can pay for the effort required to go to the health club or community health club regularly. Even if it’s within a short distance or short time,   we’re speaking about several hours of dedication per session in our own home gym to achieve our dream health and fitness. Who has time for that!  Still, all of us recognize that a workout is downright helpful for you.  Suppose you call any random 10 medical conditions and illnesses.

"Tried a different routine, is your performance lower post shoulder day?","Curious if you guys have noticed similar things. I did a large variety of shoulder exercises, and it feels like my performance with pullups has gone noticeably down when compared to per say a bench/dip day. Currently shoulder strength is the priority.

However something i do notice is that doing chest first has never really caused too much of an issue, tho with lots of shoulder pressing/hs work the performance definetely goes down in relation to what it was if i had benched instead of shoulder pressed pre pullup M bench vs M shoulder press and then pullups tuesday.

Might be worth doing pullups at the start of the week at some point if i wanna see my peak performance.

Dominik Sky Mentorship could be a scam,"First of all sorry for my shitty english.

I want to share my experience with the so called Sky Mentorship from Dominik Sky and warn others of this potential scam.

Some time ago I found this Sky Mentorship on YouTube and thought, why not giving it a try. The mentorship was supposed to be a personalized guide from experts.

So I had an appointment with one of their ?staff? Let's call him James. (can't remember his name. I think it wasn't his real name anyway). We met in Zoom and we talked for 1 hour. First James wanted me to talk about my training experience and my current problems in calistenics. I explained my situation, the typical plateau in like everything and how my current routine looks like. After that, James gave me an overview of their 'service'. Individual training routines, why my routine was trash and why I am stuck on this plateau. 

At the end, he made an offer (verbally). If I'd pay 1.700 €, I would have gained access to all the things he pointed out earlyer for life time. But due to their full schedule they couldn't offer individual support but access to 'all the knowledge Dominik has' with videos. This would have costed me only 1.500 € BUT this offer was a one time chance. Also there was only one chance. If I delince this offer, they won't come in contact with me in the future. I had to decide in this moment. He gave me a link via Zoom to the payment. 1.500 € with Paypal.

All this made me think because it seemed weird and here is why:

\-In my opinion the price is absurd. Think about it. Where I life, a normal gym membership with trainers and all the other stuff and staff costs 30€ per month. That's a bit more than 4 years of membership if you summ it up to 1.5k

\-I had no valid information about getting my money back, If I won't like it. He said for one month I had guarantee. For sure...

\-They use my personal training issues as bait. It's a clever strategy to stick to the emotions to make them (the victims) taking the bite.

\-Reduce the price to make it a bit more comfortable.

\-Put pressure on the victims by the ultimatum of a limited offer.

\-No real contract. Just words.

\-I didn't know who I was talking to. I had his voice and his fake name.

\-They promised individual support but suddently they are busy and can only offer videos. For real?? There are enough videos out there already. What does Dominik know what others don't?

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to pay immediately because I was't convinced and needed some time to think about it. So he gave me another appointment 3 days later. That's not a thing they normally do, he said again. But I got time to wrap it up and decide to not take the bite.

So far, I didn't find any information of other people that have tried the Sky Mentorship. I'm pretty sure it's a scam. If I'm wrong, they need a more serious way of selling stuff.",0,"Dominik Sky Mentorship could be a scamFirst of all sorry for my shitty english.

Fencing lunges as a substitute for regular lunges,"1/4/2022                                                                                                                                Uruguay, Montevideo

Hello,

Could I replace regular lunges with fencing lunges in my workout?

Would fencing lunges work the same things as regular lunges? I'm not thinking of performing the fencing lunges explosively like in actual fencing, instead I would perform them at the same pace as regular lunges.

I'm not even a fencer, this lunge just comes more naturally to me. My goal is strength and hypertrophy.

I don't know If it's possible to link videos, so just look it up how to do a fencing lunge.

Kind regards,

Lower back problems,"a couple months back I picked up some adjustable dumbbells and started transitioning from body weight exercise to some weights at home.  This coincides with onset of winter, colder in the garage, less outdoor work/activities no more volleyball, etc.   I've noticed that doing squats with my dumbbells has been bothering my lower back.  Precovid I was doing about 225 on a squat rack.  With dumbbells I worked up to 55s. 

Historically I have always has some lower back issues.  I used to be a ""weights"" guy,  but as I got older, I just could never get enough sleep.  Then Covid hit, gyms closed, and I kinda liked doing body weight routines outside (and also got lazier too)...

So I decided to abandon the weights this summer, and focus on the often neglected things.   I recently got an ab roller to hit my core better than planking.  Some reading on Mens Health mentions glute bridges that are good for your hips which in turn helps.

Transition from pull up negatives to regular pull ups,"Hey everyone,

I (33, male, 60kg at 171) recently started working out again and I'm following the RR. I have worked out in the past and am not a complete beginner. My goal is to gain muscle and finally getting a physique I can be proud of.
So first of all thanks to this community for putting together all that information for people like me. It helps a lot.

I have a specific question regarding the pull up progression. I can do 4-5 regular pull ups on rings with proper form. However, I first began with negatives, since I don't see myself doing 3 sets of 5 regulars. When I do 3 sets of regulars, reps decrease over the sets and I end up with only 2 or 3 in the last set. 
Is that still better than sticking to negatives, or does that mean I'm just not ready for regular pull ups in my routine.
And adding to that, when would I change from negatives to regulars. 
And is there a progression for negatives in itself, since they can be quite differently challenging depending on how long you take to go down.

Many questions, thanks in advance.",0,"Transition from pull up negatives to regular pull upsHey everyone,

I (33, male, 60kg at 171) recently started working out again and I'm following the RR. I have worked out in the past and am not a complete beginner. My goal is to gain muscle and finally getting a physique I can be proud of.
So first of all thanks to this community for putting together all that information for people like me. It helps a lot.

I have a specific question regarding the pull up progression. I can do 4-5 regular pull ups on rings with proper form. However, I first began with negatives, since I don't see myself doing 3 sets of 5 regulars. When I do 3 sets of regulars, reps decrease over the sets and I end up with only 2 or 3 in the last set. 
Is that still better than sticking to negatives, or does that mean I'm just not ready for regular pull ups in my routine.
And adding to that, when would I change from negatives to regulars.

Why exercise builds muscles: titin mechanosensing controls skeletal muscle growth under load,"Interesting paper proposing a biological mechanism for muscle growth in response to resistance training from the Cavendish Labs in Cambridge. Nothing earth shattering from the POV of current practice, but the proposed mechanism does a much better job of explaining things than 'exercise damages the muscles which regrow bigger'. (Feel free to skip all the maths: the introduction &amp; conclusions give a reasonable overview...)

(FX) Technology in Exercise,"Technology has evolved the day to day life of individuals as it has completely changed the way of living and doing business. One of the modern trends and major resources in this is, of course, the use of mobile applications. Technology makes many things better and easier. Health and Fitness are no exception. Apps and smartphones have become a considerable part of today's culture and overruling everyone's life with their ease of use and significant features.

    ""How do mobile health and fitness apps help the user?""

The market is flooded with numerous health and fitness apps each offering different advantages. A person aspiring to become more fit can choose from among these options. Let us take a look at how mobile apps help us stay in shape.

• Apps have made fitness routines more affordable and accessible:

You no longer need to go hunting for a yoga class or gym in your neighborhood or hire costly personal trainers to lose weight. Just look up a suitable app that meets your needs, install it on your Smartphone or Android and start pumping. Distance and money can no longer prevent people from exercising.

• Set realistic fitness goals:

There are many of us who aspire to look like supermodels regardless of our lifestyles. We may be trapped in sedentary lifestyles and jobs which offer little or no opportunities for fitness. Setting up an unreachable goal at the beginning of our workout regime can be the catalyst for starting the fitness regime, but is hardly sustainable. Apps like Couch to 5K help to set up realistic goals within our desired time frame. They take us to the next level of exercise only after we achieve the previous target. This helps in sustaining our exercise regime which is the hardest challenge for beginners!

• Apps help to monitor your workout routines: 

There are mobile apps that will need you to put data like your calorie intake, your daily routine, your fitness regime, and your fitness goals. They will monitor your calorie intake and calories burnt throughout the day. They will offer encouraging comments throughout your workout regime and tell you how to perform a particular exercise. Myfitnesspal and Edmundo Sports Tracker are apps that store our personal workout history and motivate us to outdo our best performance. 

Running apps like Runtastic help us to see our running progress. If you are bored of your running workout, you may use apps like Zombies run to change your regime and make it more interesting. This app turns your daily runs into epic missions. Each run you go on is like an episode of a zombie show and you’re the main character. All you need to do to get started is to start a mission and listen to the story as you run. What makes it more exciting is that you hear zombie sounds as you run and the only way to get away from them is to get moving. Often we feel dehydrated while running. There is an app to monitor your water intake as well! It’s called Waterlogged and it pushes you to take water at regular intervals during your run.

• Offer new ideas for your workout regime: 

Apps like Jefit and Body fitness are advanced apps that suggest new resistance training workouts for specific muscles in our body. The Yoga app and Tai Chi are more apps that give specific pictures, instructions, and videos to improve your workout and stretch-on-the-go.

• Monitor our diet and suggest healthy methods of cooking:

It is well-accepted fact that for losing weight and improving our overall health, diet is as important a factor as our fitness regimes. If you are concerned about the food you are eating, there is no shortage of apps to advice you about healthy options of food to choose, the nearest dietary store or restaurant, healthy methods of cooking a particular foodstuff and calculate the number of calories you consumed and need to burn! MyNetDiary and CalorieCounter are two popular apps in this category.

• Apps help us to stay connected with people having the same fitness goals:

Some health apps like iMapMyRide, FitGang, and iMapMyFitness are linked to social networking sites like Facebook. They help us to connect with people having the same fitness goals and following the same fitness regimes. This helps to build an inspiring community of health lovers and even offer healthy competition among the members.

Am I on the right track?,"Hi all, happy new year!

I have been going over this question in my mind for a while now and I cannot seem to figure it out completely.

I’m 26 y/o, about 83kg, 185cm tall, and started training with weights back in November. I’ve been lurking on this sub for a long time and have friends who have much knowledge on fitness, so I have been able to learn a bit on the subject.

I work out (right now with dumbbells due to restrictions) about 3-6 times a week, on average more like 4-5 times.
It’s not a bodyweight routine, sorry about that, but I am not sure where else to post this - I’ve seen people getting great advice on here so I figured it’s worth a shot.

I am currently on an about 1800-2000 kcal/day diet, with a ‘zigzag’ moment in the weekends (where I eat a bit more in ‘cheat days’: around 2500 kcal on 2 days). On average, that means I have a calorie intake of about 15000 kcal a week, so 2150/day. I take 2 scoops of Whey and try to prioritise proteines in my meals (chicken &amp; egg or sandwiches, chicken thigh for dinner, etc.); overall about 130 grams of proteine a day. I also started eating more healthily regarding my carbs (whole wheat pasta and whatnot).

I made some good progress in the meantime, but I am not sure if what I am doing is the best way to go for me right now. My friend told me my calorie intake is too low and will cause me to lose weight too quickly. 

I am not sure what to do now. I enjoy the progress I made already (as well as the speed), but I also want to do it all as healthily as I can. 

What do you guys advise me to do? Am I in the way of my own progress? Should I increase calorie intake, or keep the status quo? 

Thanks in advance!",0,"Am I on the right track?Hi all, happy new year!

Is my training plan sufficiently diverse?,"Now with no climbing gyms available due to lockdown 😭 I have been strength training 5-6 times per week, instead of the usual 3 times. I used rely on bouldering to ensure sufficient diversity of movement, with that missing I'm now more dependent on proper programming. I pick one workout from below every day I train. All are done circuit style, with next exercise every 3 minutes. All relevant exercises are done using rings.  

One armed pullup workout, 5 rounds (45min):

* Pseudo planche pushups for 5-10 reps.
* One armed pullup for 5 reps, with 25% counter weight, left hand.
* One armed pullup for 5 reps, with 25% counter weight, right hand.

Frontlever workout, 6 rounds (55min).

* Side lunge for 10 reps, with focus on range and mobility, left leg.
* Side lunge for 10 reps, with focus on range and mobility, right leg.
* Straddle front lever for 15-20 seconds.

Deadhang workout, 5 rounds (45min).

* Deadhang for 20-40 seconds 18mm edge half crimp and 45% counter weight, left hand.
* Deadhang for 20-40 seconds 18mm edge half crimp and 45% counter weight, right hand.
* Wide pullups for 7-10 reps, back arched chest to ""bar"", pause at top.

Been in ketosis for 5 years, cardio wise in reasonably good shape (cooper test 3100m).

Questions:

"I terribly suck at pullups, how do you increase endurance specifically?","Hello everyone, thanks for anyone taking the time reading this and providing any insight. Well, I think the title is rather self explanatory. My pullup game is terribly weak. I currently 158lbs (72kg) for 5'11 (1M78). 

Fresh first set of pullups without any pre exhaustion, I can maybe squeeze between 13-15 pullups. The next set, I'll do at best 10. My third, I get 7. By my fourth set, I am absolutely fried and would be lucky to get 6 reps. I don't know why this happens. Pullups is the only exercise that I find really taxing and extremely tough to get consistent sets. For context, I mainly lift weights but I've always incorporated pullups. I can get a consistent amount of reps in any other excercise. Except pullups. I'm really to a point where I think I'm unable to get 4x12 4x10 pullups. 

If I leave my pullups as my last finishing exercise, I am literally a champ if I can get 4X7.

Help with PPL workout routine,"Hi guys,

I've been working out consistently for over a year and I feel like I plateaued a few months ago. I do a PPL split where I try to alternate (don't always end up doing it) between high volume/lower weight days and low vol/higher weight day. I'm 24, 5'7, M, BF is around 11-14% I think. Diet is fine for the most part, counted calories for a while but stopped recently, just cautious with some foods and I get enough protein in.

Also, I workout at home so I have limited equipment for the most part. I have 90lbs adjustable dumbells, squat rack with a pull bar, barbell with weights going up to 330lbs. Leg extension+hamstring curl machine and resistance bands.

My Pull day looks something like this:

Superset: 3 sets of barbell rows (125lbs) + 3 sets of shrugs (125lbs)

3 sets of dumbell rows (70lbs)

3-4 sets of wide grip pull ups, sometimes I add 3 more sets of close grip as well

3 sets of seated bicep curls (35lbs)

3 sets of seated hammer curls (35lbs)

3 sets of either preacher curls or chin ups

My Push day looks something like this:

4 sets of incline dumbell press (70 lbs)

4 sets of flat bench press (I sometimes alternate between dumbell press (75 lbs) or close grip barbell bench press (145lbs)

3 sets push ups

Superset: 3 sets skull crushers (25lbs) along with 3 sets chest flies (25lbs)

Superset: 3 sets tricep kickbacks (25lbs) + 3 sets dips

3 sets Shoulder press (55lbs)

Superset: 3 sets of lateral raise (20lbs) + 3 sets of bent over lateral raise (20lbs)

Legs:

4 sets barbell squats (320-330lbs)

3 sets of Romanian deadlifts (150 lbs)

Superset: 3 sets of leg extensions (85 lbs) + 3 sets leg curls (75 lbs)

3 sets of Bulgarian split squats (40 lbs)

3 sets of either pistol squats (75 lbs + resistance band) or 3 sets of jump squats (resistance band)

I sometimes do a 5 min leg workout that includes side lunges, donkey kicks, hip thrusts...

I'm trying to take it easy with my pull days since I recently injured my back so I'm trying to go low in weights until I feel comfortable. I'm really struggling in going up in weight for my push day especially since I work out alone at home and I don't have anyone to spot me most of the time. I made a lot of progress with legs but I don't really have more plates to go up in weight for squats (also I don't really want to do more than what I am doing right now since I feel like it is already high enough for my size). I try working out 6 days a week. I want to gain more muscle and lose a bit more belly fat so I'm just looking for advice on what I should change?

I'm trying to take it easy with my pull days since I recently injured my back so I'm trying to go low in weights until I feel comfortable. I'm really struggling in going up in weight for my push day especially since I work out alone at home and I don't have anyone to spot me most of the time. I made a lot of progress with legs but I don't really have more plates to go up in weight for squats (also I don't really want to do more than what I am doing right now since I feel like it is already high enough for my size). I try working out 6 days a week. I want to gain more muscle and lose a bit more belly fat so I'm just looking for advice on what I should change? Any help would be really appreciated."

Why are my triceps the only things that hurt???,"Okay, so a bit of context first. I've been doing pushups for years, consistently getting higher in volume, speed and weight (in a backpack) for about 5 years. During the first while I got pain in most places, shoulders, chest and triceps (maybe even lats). Obviously I expect that. After that initial period of time though, I only ever got pain in my triceps? Nothing else hurt anymore, I thought, 'oh it's probably just taking longer to develop' but NO. I refuse to believe after over 4 years of doing this exercise, that my triceps are still ""just weak"", surely there is something wrong right? Anyone else experience this, if so, how did you fix it? It's not the same pain as I get in other muscles or even when I do triceps based excersizes like dips or skullcrushers, it's sharper and js really impeding my performance.",0,"Why are my triceps the only things that hurt???Okay, so a bit of context first.

"Afraid to lose weight when doing Body Weight Fitness exercise, what should I do?","Hello! This is my first post here so go easy on me.

 I've been wanting to gain weight and muscle since I am underweight, and I think the BWF Primer is a step in the right direction (I haven't excercise in 2 weeks recently) I'm a 17 year old male, 5'5 and weigh 106 pounds. According to the Weight Gain Calculator, I would need to eat about 2900 calories each day to reach my goal of 140 pounds in 6 months. Should I eat a lot of high calorie and protein foods (healthy foods, of course) while doing the BWF Primer and eventually the Recommended Routine?

Any good workout websites/advice?,"Today, I was looking for new workouts on the Internet, and I came to a seemingly good article by Mens Health.

Surprisingly everybody seems to agree that planks are good although I'm sure in a few years they will be seen as garbage too. There is just so much conflicting information.

So, are there any good reliable sites with workouts that actually do something? Either recommend sites with workouts that are actually effective, sites to avoid, or workouts that work for you. I trust the various workout communities on Reddit more than I trust the 295983963959 workout sites and the Google ""experts"".

Eagle loops grip for fingers when doing dead hangs throughout day?,"[Eagle loops](https://imgur.com/5DODID4)

Hi guys, so, in a typical day I walk past my pull up bar and do a few dead hangs. (Hoping to loosen tight lats). I heard about these loops and thought it would help strengthen my fingers? Perhaps have some carryover into climbing, maybe even some weird kind of conditioning?

Figured why not add the Eagle loops whilst hanging as a 2 in 1. 

Sounds like a good idea. What should I expect strength wise or carryover wise?

E.g, for my lat stretching, I'm walking past and doing a 1 minute (ish) dead hang, adding the straps whilst doing that would enable me to hang AND get some kind of finger conditioning.

Noob Want to start Calisthenics," Hi folks,

I’m a noob in fitness and I want to start working my way up in calisthenics. I’m sick and tired of searching this topic on Google as I get bombarded with ads there and following that on Facebook and Instagram. I have no experience, so I can’t really tell which program is good. 

Little bit about me. I’m 44, 6 feet and about 200 lbs. I consider myself on the beginning of the heavy side. I can run 2-3 miles with 5 mph on a treadmill and do not have any major injuries. I can’t really do any pull-ups and only 6-7 push-ups in a set. 

What is the systematic way to start building my core for calisthenics? I need an easy to follow daily, weekly, monthly regimen. I have watched lot of YouTube videos, but no one talks about getting started from zero when one can’t do a single pull-up. Most of them are from trainers who want to sell their programs. I’m not opposed to paying, but as I said earlier, I have no way to know if these programs are any good. A lot of people say they’re ripoffs.

Powerbuilding VS calesthenics,"I have a lot off experience with powerbuilding it was my main workout source before Corona. When everything closed I turned to calesthenics. With this I had a lot more progression in how I look(probably also had to do with there being no parties). Now back to today the gym is back open. Now i'm twisted so much between the two that I asked myself if others blended them.

First some personal pro's and cons 

Pro's calesthenics:
* You train everything even small muscles like stability in your wrist or grip strength. 
* Training sessions are usually much shorter with same exhaustion of the muscles afterwards (how I felt it)
* It's like cardio and strength training in one
* You do have more functional strength

Cons:
*Training chest is difficult because after dips exercises become more difficult in stability and schouder rotation strength then pure pec strength like planche.
*Leg training is also hard because when you reach pistol squats. The only good ones are jumping squats and pistol squats.

Pro's powerlifting:
*With squats and deadlifts your posture is rock solid. Which has benefits for a lot off aspects in my life.
*You do get really strong and feel powerfull. But only on certain lifts
 
Cons: 
* If you want to train everything you are busy for 90 minutes or more 
* I often forgot wrist strength and now my wrist sometimes hurt when using them to much
* If you don't know how to balance your workouts you often have unbalanced physique(a lot off insecurity in self made programs)
* Full body is also difficult because in a single workout you train every muscle but not as it should (back: only vertical or horizontal pull. One of the 2 is missing)

Also research on adding calesthenics in gym workouts always leads to pure calesthenics, not with added lifts of the big 5.

So I was wondering if any of you have a calisthenics workout with added big lifts?

Any workout recommendations?,"Basically I (21F if it matters) have never worked out in my life (other than for Sport in school, also when I was very little I did hip-hop, but I haven't done that since I was 9 and 3 years ago I took fitness classes for about 3 months but that's it)

I don't really have a problem keeping up with more intense workouts (I'm not sure, but everything I've tried I could do), but I'm always afraid that I'm doing it wrong. I tried Chloe Ting workouts a couple of times because a friend told me they are beginner level and I found them okay, I could keep up, but a lot of the exercises aren't explained in detail and I have no idea if I'm doing them right. Afterwards (the day after) I often get backpain. I've tried her workouts multiple times because I really enjoy them and I really want to get into them (especially the ab workouts) and it feels like I'm not killing myself, but I'm also doing something.

I don't want to loose weight, I'm very happy with my body right now and I don't really want it to change (I'd love to get abs maybe and I'd love to get slightly more toned but no big changes). The reason why I want to work out is because before the pandemic started I was a very active person. I'm a terrible driver, so I'd walk anywhere, even if it's a 1-2 hour walk.  Now, my classes are online, my work is online, so that eliminates a lot of the walking. Surprisingly I haven't really gained weight, but I also have a lot less appetite so maybe that's why. I just want to exercise because I feel very immobile and it's making me unmotivated and sometimes depressed. I'm looking for exercises that would substitute the everyday activities I used to have. Nothing too intense and properly explained so I know that I'm doing it right.

Sorry for the long description, I felt it was necessary to explain what exactly I'm looking for.

At-home replacement for the RR?,"Hello! Living in a cold and rainy city, I often had to ""backup"" to a different at-home training for those days in which it is either too cold or raining too much. By doing this, I noticed that when I went back to RR, I of course had harder time to follow the same reps as I used to do before the forced stay-at-home situation.

One option would clearly be to go to a gym, but one of the reasons I chose bodyweight is that you don't need a gym to exercise, and you can do it pretty much everywhere.

So my question is whether there is a good stay-at-home alternative to most of the RR exercises, depending on the path I have taken?

Strap Cable Width ? Gym Rings,"Hello,

Happy New Year, Best wishes to all !!

I recently got my first gym rings, but I've been uncomfortable using them because of the width of the strap cable. I spend most time being concerned about the cables breaking then working out,
but this is more a confidence issue then a defective product.  

It comes with the regular sized stability strap (around 1 inch wide), so I guess if the rings comes with them, they should be reliable enough for a beginner around 200lb.

I have a pair of ratchet strap 2 inch wide, which is obviously more heavy duty, but will it work if I use them instead?

I know it's a more ""it's in your head"" concern, but will the width of the cable affect the ring in any negative ways?

Study shows Chin-ups and Wide Grip Pull-ups pose higher risk of shoulder impingement over shoulder width Pull-ups,"[Scapula kinematics of pull-up techniques: Avoiding impingement risk with training changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916995/)



Very interesting. I've always known (and perhaps everyone here) that wide grip pull ups are dangerous for the shoulders. What got me is how the chin up is riskier than normal pull-ups. I was under the (wrong) impression that the external rotation from the chin-up created more space in the shoulder complex, thereby reducing the chances of shoulder impingement. I was wrong. Regular pull ups might be the way to go for anyone with shoulder impingement and those who want to avoid it. How about neutral grip pull ups?

**TLDR:**  *High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk.*",0,"Study shows Chin-ups and Wide Grip Pull-ups pose higher risk of shoulder impingement over shoulder width Pull-ups[Scapula kinematics of pull-up techniques: Avoiding impingement risk with training changes](

M/19/5'11'' 1.5 Years Progress,"https://imgur.com/a/n1doD4T

This is a 1.5 year progress. Though most progress was made in a year. January 2021 was when i started taking working out and diet more seriously. I weigh 155lbs now and idk how much i weighed in the before picture. The only thing i supplement with is creatine 

So im not the most strict person. I miss days. I miss sleep. Eat trash occasionally. But i try to be as consistent with my workouts and diets as possible and i dont stress on it when i skip a workout or eat something bad. Mental health is the most important thing to even having productive workout and diets. Lifestyle in general. Life gets in the way of a perfect program and thats okay. I just try my best at my own pace

As for my goals. I want to learn more calisthenic skills and become stronger and more mobile. I dont want to be a massive person. I like looking normal or skinny in clothes. 

I use a PPL split. I try to take most sets to failure depending on how i feel. Last sets i use drop sets until i can even barely do negatives. Except for legs i go a little easier because i tend to overtrain them if i go all out on every set and end up sore for 5 days. 

The rep ranges i use is usually 6 to 16 reps depending on the exercise. If my reps are getting too high i just add weight or use a harder progression or use a bigger range of motion

For my diet i just eat at maintenance or slightly above, just depends on how i feel. The foods i eat are tuna, eggs, greek yogurt, oatmeal, ham and turkey sandwiches, hot cheetos, chocolate trail mix, granola. Im not very strict with my diet i try to eat mostly good and make sure to eat atleast 130g of protein a day so i dont have to feel bad when i eat some unhealthy food. 

Day 1: Push

Handstand/pike pushups
Resistance band bicep curls
Pseudo planche pushups

Specific set/rep scheme to increase pullups,"To preface, I am not a bodyweight athlete. I am currently running Sheiko's powerlifting program, but outside of weights I am a rock climber. That being said, I find my pulling strength to be far weaker than my push strength when it comes to bodyweight. When fresh I can usually get a set of 5 pullups in with reps decreasing on the following sets. 

Does anyone have any specific routines I could follow at this level to increase reps? I find gtg to be a bit too unstructured for myself, and perhaps not even beneficial at the rep range I am at.

Motus: delegate your calisthenics programming,"# About

[**Motus**](https://motus.pythonanywhere.com/) is a web app designed to help the avid calisthenics practitioner delegate the programming of workouts to a system that offers variety stochastically given high-level criteria specified by the user. It was built under that premise that while consistency is key to achieving specific goals, enjoyment and (some) variety is crucial to a longer-term sustainable practice. It finally allows you to push the workout to your own Notion workspace for more permanent logging.

You specify the following criteria in each ""phase"":

* Category {Push, Pull, Legs, Core, Movement, ...}
* Equipment {Rings, Paralettes, None, Parallel Bars, ...}
* Parent Exercise {Push-up, Dip, ...}
* N, the number of exercises to sample
* N Peak Intensity, the maximum number of ""peak intensity"" exercises of the N

## Why Notion as the source?

* A UI that promotes editability and collaborative curation
* The ability to host **rich content**, form cues, and embed videos within pages
* The potential to clone others' DBs (ultimately to be able to plug in your own custom source)
* Support of semi-structured multi-select fields

## Why Notion for the output?

* Preserve rich content and form cues from the source
* Re-arrange the ordering of a workout easily
* Extend your personal Notion DB with additional logging columns
* Neatly store different workout permutations side-by-side

# FAQ

**Q: Why isn't the ordering of exercises preserved in the Notion output?**

A: Exercises are pushed *asynchronously* to Notion endpoints for a dramatic speed improvement. Rows can be sorted by sorting on the Order column in ascending order.

**Q: Can the ordering of columns be set for the Notion output?**

A: Currently Notion doesn't appear to allow you to specify the order of properties when you create a DB schema - it places the Title property first and fields are alphabetically sorted thereafter. This order can be adjusted in Notion.

**Q: Can the ordering of dropdown items be configured?**

A: The ordering is preserved from the Notion input DB source. These can be adjusted by those with edit access.

**Q: Why does the order of ""pinned"" exercises change on generation?**

A: Motus preserves the exercise but still tries to sort the workout by ring height and by peak intensity. It's possible/likely that the ordering of the pinned exercise will change.

**Q: How is this implemented?**

A: Motus is written in Python and running on Flask. Asyncio and Httpx produce huge speed improvements when interacting with Notion; we avoid waiting on IO-blocking GET/PUSH requests as we pull and push 1) exercises (Notion pages) 2) exercise content (Notion child blocks) and 3) synced exercise content (Notion synced blocks that require further dereferencing).",0,"Motus: delegate your calisthenics programming# About

Full Planche in 4 months - Will I make it?,"So I've decided to go on a little journey called 'planche', the last major obstacle before I can call myself an advanced calisthenic athlete. And I've given myself 4 months to do it.

This is where I'm currently at (filmed end of December): https://streamable.com/fkzlbt

That was about RPE 7. Right now my balance gives out before my strength does (can't even do a proper headstand for more than 8 seconds, another thing I will be working on), but I fully understand that my shoulder, chest and back strength is going to need a massive upgrade to pull this off.

So why 4 months? Because that's what works best for me. I got my first iron cross after 4 months of specific training. Anything longer than that and I tend to burn out and regress, so 1/3 of a year for a strength training cycle is the best I can do.

My 4 month training cycle will go from being about 40/60 strength/hypertrophy that it is now to about 80/20 strength/hypertrophy, doubling my strength training volume. Basically, I'll be training as a power lifter.

I will also be working heavily on the antagonist muscles to avoid postural imbalances, which means I'll also be training heavy for front lever and p-bar victorian, but after I do my planche block in the training session.

This will be the first time I share my calisthenic training journey with anyone and I mainly wrote this post to hold myself accountable (so no slacking off!!) and maybe get some tips and support from you guys. I'll be doing monthly updates until month 4, so stay tuned.",0,"Full Planche in 4 months - Will I make it?So I've decided to go on a little journey called 'planche', the last major obstacle before I can call myself an advanced calisthenic athlete.

Tips for Getting Back into Groove Post New Born and Extensive Break,"So my wife and i had our first child last June. Before then, we have always been avid fitness people, working out 4-5/week. When Covid hit, we moved to BWF and followed the RR. We saw some amazing results from it and i fell in love with this style of working out. 

A year and a half later since starting the RR, our baby finally came and I thought it would be an awesome time for a break. The plan was to take a month off and then get back at it. Well, as the old saying goes, ""the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray"". The first month came and went, then 2, then 4, then now finally 6. 

Before the baby, I honestly can't remember the last time i went even a week without working out in some way and I definitely feel it. But trying to manage the balance of a kid and working out is.... challenging. Aside from the fact i feel demotivated because i feel I lost alot of progress in that time.

Anyway, i'm thinking about starting a split routine for easing back in and time constraints. Probably the OG split routine (upper and lower).

I guess i'm looking for encouragement, motivation, and advice on how best to get back to doing something that i love.

Muscle building rep and set guidance,"Hi! Can someone in a really simple way explain the best workout routine for building muscle mass using only bodyweight exercise and light dumbells, sliders and a booty band? 
I have tried to research but a lot of the articles confuse me with their fitness terms such as volume and so on.

Also to add a bit about me i have tried a lot of different home workouts, and i enjoy pilates and yoga the most and hiit the least. I am not a fan of super high intensity exercises or high rep ranges, so something in between would be ideal. As for cardio i hate running, but love walking/hiking/dancing.


Example i would understand: “to grow muscle you should do 3-5 sets of 10-12 reps for 3-4 exercises that targets the muscle - this should be done x times per week”

Rotator cuff exercises alongside bouldering,"Hi, I tend to hurt my shoulders pretty easily when bouldering, especially on moves and holds that put the shoulder in an uncomfortable position. I have not managed to isolate which exact muscle is the problem, but I've noticed that moves that demand strength while being in heavy shoulder internal rotation, moves that force a ""chicken wing"" arm position as well as some gastons often induce a sharp pain at the back of my shoulder (which sometimes resorbs itself quickly, and sometimes lasts for a few days). It feels like a muscular issue more than tendon or ligament related, so I suspect weakness in one or several muscles of the shoulder complex, but I'm unsure which.

Here are a few photos of positions that I reckon would probably cause me discomfort or pain:

I do calisthenics besides bouldering, and my upper body routine usually revolves around a few skills + the 4 basics (chin-ups or pull-ups, bodyweight rows, pushups or dips, pike push-ups). I consider my scapular stability to be pretty good in the context of calisthenics, and the only ""imbalance"" I have noticed is that I believe my overhead pressing strength (pike push-ups) to be slightly lacking compared to the other 3 movements.

I have not done any dedicated rotator cuff training so far, but I think I may need to start doing some to prevent more shoulder pain and potentially serious injuries down the road. Any idea what specific muscle/movement pattern I need to reinforce, and some exercises to do so ? cc u/eshlow, as I know you have a lot of experience in this domain and in climbing",0,"Rotator cuff exercises alongside boulderingHi, I tend to hurt my shoulders pretty easily when bouldering, especially on moves and holds that put the shoulder in an uncomfortable position.

Learning how to workout st home has been incredible,"I was a gym rat going on 14 years before the ondemic hit. It has been an incredible journey this past year and a half exercising with minimal equipment and I am still learning g things.

Then I can lean away from it and curl myself only koving forearms, I feel way more focus on my biceps

Front lever rows and scapular retraction,"I want to see what everyone’s opinions are on the front lever row for full range strength training, specifically scapular retraction.

I value the FL row due to its crossover to static FL and as a counterbalance to horizontal pushing work.

But recently as I’ve been working on fixing some postural issues (rounded shoulders, scapular winging, impingement) I’ve noticed how the FL row doesn’t allow full ROM (range of motion) because it is almost impossible to properly retract at the bottom of the movement. 

My pull work pretty much revolves exclusively around FL work and chin-ups. But neither of these movements build scapular retraction (am I correct?). So does that mean that your average calisthenics push-pull program  (assuming mine is average) is not effectively balanced since it never allows for full scapular retraction training?

Training with a weighted vest.,"Hello,

 I am considering getting a weighted vest for a while now, since I am not interested in building skills by performing more complex moves and I only care about health, aesthetics and strength. I have been training in calisthenics for a few months in a disciplined manner (3 times a week, decent quality training programme, decent quality diet), and a couple years in an undisciplined one (low quality training programmes, weeks and occasionally months of not training due to low morale, low quality diet). 

 I believe that a weighted vest will offer more gains in all aspects, and will achieve it in less time than pure bodyweight exercise, however I want to be sure I am making the right choice and that it is worth it before acquiring one, since they are costly.

 In case it matters, my level as of now is something like this: Can perform 30 consecutive push ups with good form, can perform 50 consecutive squats with good form, can perform 10 consecutive neutral grip pull ups with good form, can perform 100 consecutive sit ups with good form.

 So my questions are:

• Good/best time to start using one? (Right from the beginning vs after you've gotten a level of familiarity with calisthenics).

• How many kilograms should one start with? How many if someone is a beginner, how many if someone is already a calisthenics athlete who wants to advance his level?

• Your personal experiences and choices with weighted calisthenics. Any information is useful. 

 Thanks in advance. 

(In case you're wondering, ""Why the fuck is this post so verbose? He could've described it faster..."", Here's the answer: There is an auto-moderator bot in this subreddit, which unless you write a well-constructed essay, will remove your post for so-called ""Lack of effort"".)",0,"Training with a weighted vest.Hello,

Long time gym goer with longer time shoulder injury,"Little background - 33 Year old Male, 6 foot 6, very athletic, normally eating high protein low carb and medium fat diet, 6-10% body fat, was in the gym 6-7 days a week for the past 15 years (1-2 hrs a day) 

Have been dealing with and on off shoulder issues since I was 18 (maxing out on the bench press every other workout - not recommended, but so was every other 18 year old back then, lol!) 

Figured out things to do that didn’t bother it. 

That changed during Covid. Got worse last January, had a really hard time taking time off, kept trying to work through it - got realllllly bad pain in the front of my shoulder when benching. 

Got MRI’s with contrast, without, PT, twice, time off (months), nothing helping. Front side and back of shoulder pain when I exert energy or when I sleep on it (stinks cause I’m definitely a side sleeper)

Also - my left shoulder, is starting to act weird. Whenever I’m doing a hammer biceps lift, every time, it sounds like the creaking and cracking are at an all new level. Others can hear it 10 yards away. 

Left shoulder is ok but seemingly getting worse - MRI showed “signaling” of a lateral tear but no big deal. 

Right shoulder should small laberal tear, it was more clear. They think there might be something going on with the biceps tendon shoulder insertion but not sure….

Doctor one stays shouldn’t do surgery, doctor two says yes labrum and maybe biceps surgery, doctor three is thinking there’s a nerve issue (which there isn’t).

I’ve tried cortisone I’ve tried PT rest lifting through it, HATE the idea of surgery mostly because I feel like I’ll never be able to go 100% with it again (I mean I’ll take 90%… :)) but does anyone here have experience , thoughts, supplements, feelings or anyyything at all they would recommend because I am DESPERATE!!!

Muscle Imbalances from soccer,"I've been trying to figure out for the longest time how to deal with my muscle imbalances from soccer. For reference I kick with my right leg. I've noticed that in terms of balance  (think single leg squats) my left leg is stronger since I used it to plant before kicking, whereas I'm still wobbly on my right leg (knee tends to cave in so I have to focus more).

As for glute definition from the side (think mirror side view ""p"") my right glute is more lifted and bigger than the left (I guess you could say the left side looks like the before and the right looks like the after). This makes sense since I was kicking back so much on my right side so it feels like my left glute is either inactive or the muscle isn't as developed.

Whats a good way to correct this issue. Also if you've struggled with the same issue before, how long did it take before you were able to correct the issue and how often did you perform your exercises?

i need guidance on how to do this. specific routines i shoudl follow and how many times a week. ifi this was you and you had three months to do this how would you go about it? been looking at potentially just using kinstretch PAILS/RAILS 2-3 times per week. or that GMB wrist routine daily? a bit lost to be honest.

How can I achieve this strength? Please read :),"Hi, I'm fairly new to calisthenics and pretty weak. I have a skinny friend (5'9, 56kg/120lbs), who inspires me. He's got reaaally skinny legs and an alright upper body. He doesn't look like he could, but does all kinds of muscle ups with ease. Standard, close grip, wide and even reverse grip muscle ups. He also has a record of 30 clean pullups.

I find it fascinating how easily he pulls up like it's nothing. My question is: how can I get that kind of strength? Will I also pull up as explosively if I lose weight off of my legs? The logical answer is to gain muscle, i know, but my friend barely has muscle mass and does so many movements with ease.

He's got reaaally skinny legs and an alright upper body. He doesn't look like he could, but does all kinds of muscle ups with ease. Standard, close grip, wide and even reverse grip muscle ups. He also has a record of 30 clean pullups.

I find it fascinating how easily he pulls up like it's nothing. My question is: how can I get that kind of strength? Will I also pull up as explosively if I lose weight off of my legs?

Look for feedback/critique on my pull up and dip form,"Hey bodyweight fitness community! I (33M) have been training (recommended routine) on and off since lockdown, around May of 2020. Before this I had no formal training and pretty minimal workout experience.  I have really come to appreciate this community for its guidance and impact. I recently moved to a new place, and have my own gym set up at home, and as I'm starting to get back into training, I decided to reach out and get some advice/feedback on my form.

I usually train with weights, either a dip belt or a weight vest, but decided to hold off jumping back into that until I've worked out the kinks in my form.

My arms are incredibly weak what should i do to make them better?,"For example, i cant bench 40lbs because my arms give out near the 7th pulldown. I cant do 5 pushups because my arms also give out. I train arms every two days because i want them to be stronger and better but its not progressing that much. 
Its been 3 months since ive started training and i wasnt able to do a single pushup but still my pecs are doing just fine during any type of exercise, its just my arms. Its frustrating seeing my peers take on 50lbs and 70lbs while im stuck with a hard time benching just 40lbs. They have progressed faster then i have even though im the only one working out hours once im home. What the hell body?

Rings to get that hang from pull up bar?,"I am looking to order some rings from Amazon preferably that would hang at an appropriate height from my pull-up bar. My bar hangs about 6.5 feet above the floor and I want rings that will allow me to do rows but the rings I’m seeing on Amazon at near 15 feet length which is far too much.  

I don’t have any other door frames that would allow me to hang the bar from a greater height, and I can’t drill or mess with any walls to install cables/rings which is why I would like to hang them from my bar.

Does anyone know of any rings I should purchase and what the ideal length of the straps would be?

Is it safe to do calisthenics every day?,"I spent 2021 getting in the best shape I've been yet with mostly weightlifting, cardio, and tackling my diet. For reference I'm 22, 5'11"" and weighing in at about 165-170lb with 14% bodyfat. I work out 5 days a week and have recently started to include a lot more calisthenics. Now I'm curious if doing this daily is not only safe but will help me see the progress I want. Ideally, I'd like to get my bodyfat percentage down to about 9-11% while still retaining my muscle mass or even increasing it. Below I'll post my typical workout routine and calorie intake. I'd appreciate any and all criticisms, suggestions, and advice! I repeat my calisthenics rotation prior to weightlifting each day, in my list below after Monday I'll refer to it as ""Calisthenics rotation"" to shorten the post length.

Mon: 1 mile run to warmup 

Pullups, Chin-ups, Dips - 3 sets each until fail

25 squat jumps, 50 crunches, 20 pushups, 10 burpees, 30 seconds calf jumps (3 sets each, or until fail)

4-5 leg focused weightlifting workouts. (Squats, sumo squats, calf raises, hamstring curls etc.) 

Tue: 1 mile run warmup

Calisthenics rotation 

5-6 Weightlifting exercises varying between biceps, triceps, and forearms. 

Wed: 1 mile run 

Calisthenics rotation

5-6 Chest focused weightlifting exercises (Bench, fly, incline barbells etc.)

Thur: 1 mile run 

Calisthenics rotation 

4-5 Shoulder focused weightlift exercises (Military press, shrugs, front/side raises etc.) 

Fri: 1 mile run 

Calisthenics rotation 

4-5 back focused weightlift exercises (deadlift, lat pull down, rows etc.) 

Sat/Sun: Rest days 

BMR estimate = 1800 calories. AMR estimate = 2800 calories. Daily calorie intake = 2200-2300

I know my regimen is FAR from perfect as I'm still new to calisthenics and my goal with it currently is to increase the volume of my reps and sets in the basic categories prior to moving onto varying workouts. As I mentioned prior though I'd absolutely love to get some advice and maybe even have a new routine to tackle starting this Monday.

advise on buying my first pair of gymnastic rings,"hello guys. so after predominantly weight training my entire life im slowly moving towards bodyweight styles of training, or rather, incorporating bodyweight fitness into my training,

i have decided to invest in a pair of rings which i very excited about. having never owned/ used a pair of rings before i had some questions

firstly: im a small guy with small-sized hands. should i just go for the fig standard 1.11 thickness or the larger 1.25. as i said before i do have smaller hands and assuming the thinner ring will be more comfrotable, but just wanting to know from other individuals. for the time being i am leaning towards the 1.11 thickness

secondly: how long should the straps be? the plan will be to hang the rings of a power rack pull up bar approximately 8ft high. currently im looking at the rogue wood rings which come with a 16' strap. would that be adequate to lower it to a height comfortable for dips and push ups or do i need something longer?

I want to work out but I'm afraid of injury.,"Heya r/fitness,

I've been wanting to lose weight, but one of the main things holding me back is fear of injury. It feels like every time I research an exercise, there are warnings of poor form, or potential muscle imbalances. Or when I research a particular exercise that one group of people says is great and almost essential, for example sit-ups, I'll find just as many people telling me to not do sit-ups if I want a healthy spine. I can't afford a personal trainer, nor to go to the gym, and so I'm afraid I'm going to do significant damage, particularly with lifting exercises.

I only own a barbell and cannot afford dumbells, so I've been trying to find alternatives to dumbell exercises, but I run into problems with imbalances.


Sorry for the rant, it's just been frustrating trying to stay motivated when things like this pile on.

Any help is appreciated, thank you.",0,"I want to work out but I'm afraid of injury.Heya r/fitness,

My 10 years Calisthenics progress,"Hey guys 😊 

I just put together a video of my 10 years journey with Calisthenics, handstand and movement training. I have spent months digging through old hard drives, online drives, SoMe archives etc and a lot of time cutting this piece of content together 😅 

[my 10 year Calisthenics progress](https://youtu.be/ODhoHVp4QoI)

For a more detailed picture for you guys, here are some more specifics:

I had some background in the gym in high school before 2011. Just the average “wanted to pack on some muscle so I did bench press and biceps curls 2 times a week”.

I could also do handstand walks and wall assisted handstand from playing around on my trampoline and back yard. Other than this I did football (soccer) for a long time, but skateboarding was my main thing from middle school through high school. 

I am 179cm tall and in 2011 I weighed in at about 71kg. I am now 82kg. Body fat % never measured, never cared.

Here are the yearly milestones achieved from when starting Calisthenics in 2011:

Starting stats:
3 pull-ups, about 40 push-ups and dips (don’t remember the number)

2011:
Somewhere between 5 and 10 pull-ups (remember I didn’t achieve 10), 1st wall assisted handstand push-up, one arm push-up.

2012:
First free standing handstand, 10+ pull-ups, tuck planche, dragon flag and 10 leg raises.

2013:
1st freestanding HSPU, improved handstand (maybe around 30 sec hold and started working in form), back lever, human flag and 1st muscle up.

2014: 
1st 90 degree push-up, improved handstands, hollow back handstand, 1st shitty straddle planche hold.

2015:
Improvements everywhere, first one arm pull-up (barely and lost it later due to injury), started training for one arm handstand.

2016:
More focus on mobility, improved strength and rep numbers for HSPU, 90 deg, MU, etc. And started working more on explosive HSPU work and creative strength sequences.

2017: 
1st one arm handstand holds (10s best, but inconsistent), 1st straddle Planche press,

2018:
Focused a lot on street workout for my last year of competing, started training different OAHS shapes (flags, tuck, full etc.)

2019:
1st inverted muscle up (bar), 1st OAHS to croc, 10 reps of 90 degree push-up, started training for the one arm handstand push-up (due to an injury preventing me from training the 90 degree range).

2020:
More creative strength work and improvement in most strength exercises. One arm handstand improved a lot (very consistent holds and shapes).

2021: 
1st full planche, 1st full front lever, 1st time 2 reps of one arm chins. Improvement in everything else too. Big improvements in one arm handstand push-up training. 

It may also be of interest to you guys to know about the injuries I have sustained through the years😅

Tennis elbow (maybe 4 rounds on each side), golfers elbow (2 rounds left arm), tendinitis of long biceps head, partial separation of AC joint (what had me start my OA-HSPU training), labrum tear of left shoulder, 2 MC joint sprains (had to do my HSPU training in knuckles for a few months), wrist sprain from twisting my hand, forearms splints (on and off for 2 years in the beginning of my journey), the occasion pulled muscle (mostly chest and lats).

As my training has grown smarter and I have focused more on preventative work and mobility, injuries are less frequent the past few years😊

Most optimal routine for muscle hypertrophy?,"I apologize if this has been asked before.

I saw a post the other day asking about calisthenics vs weight lifting for muscle hypertrophy and most seemed to say that weight lifting was superior. 

My goal is to have my dream body aesthetically. 

Through my research, I have heard people state that their version of training hard is 2 hours daily with maybe one rest day for the week. Whether this is good or bad, I don’t know, but their body speaks for itself. 

No disrespect to anybody on this subreddit at all, but I have seen a lot of body transformations from the recommended routine over the course of a year for so, and I am personally not satisfied with the results. I can definitely see a positive change in all of them, but I can’t help but think that different routines or training harder in some way would get better results. 

I did the recommended routine very consistently for a year as well with unsatisfying results. Maybe it also comes down to the fact that I bulked the whole time?

I feel like I’m rambling now. My question is still just simply this: is there any way to improve the recommended routine’s effectiveness if you have access to weights aside from just doing weighted versions of the exercises in the routine? 

I am thinking of hiring a personal trainer or something to help me in this regard, but I don’t see how it would be much different from consulting with a knowledgeable community like y’all.

Thanks for reading and happy new year.  

TL;DR - I have weights. Are there better exercises to replace or add to the RR to increase its effectiveness? Or would an entirely different routine be more effective? Even the FAQ implies that the RR is inferior to a routine you could cultivate with additional equipment and weights.",0,"Most optimal routine for muscle hypertrophy?I apologize if this has been asked before.

Short full-body routine with basic equipments?,"PS: This is more of a weighted workout question than BWF but other fitness related subreddits remove my questions automatically for some reason, so I had to ask here. Please remove if against the rules

I have been training on and off (mostly off) for the past few years and almost always the reason that makes me quit is how much time or effort my workouts take. I am having trouble fitting long routines into my day if it takes more than 45 minutes (so RR too), sometimes mentally and sometimes because of work. I reckon any amount of workout is better than no workout, so to make this into a habit I decided to make the whole ritual shorter. 

I know it might not be as effective as some other stuff but how far can I go building muscles with 20-30 mins of full-body exercises? I have been doing 1 or 1.5 rounds (not strong enough for two rounds yet) of Thenx's 15 min fullbody workout (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCykac8elPw) every other day for a week now.

Home Routine Recommendations,"Hi, I’m (30s, male) looking to start working out at home around three times per week. My ordinary exercise is just walking, running and occasionally cycling. I’ve never done weight training before. My body just doesn’t feel very strong, my goal is to simply build some muscle and work out all muscle groups on my body, so a comprehensive workout which targets everything. 

Are there a handful of exercises that you guys would recommend that fit the criteria? I’ve come up with a list so far of squats, dumbbell rows, push ups, planks, lunges, jumping jacks and sit ups.

Also, is there a list of stretches which correspond to the above, again something comprehensive? 

I’m not looking for an extreme transformation, just to help maintain a healthy body and improve my strength a little. I don’t want to join a gym and prefer just to work out at home. I can buy some dumbbells if required.

Bodyweight Routine Critique/Suggestions moving forward,"Basic information

5'9""
173lbs

I started 2021 at 200lbs and never done any sort of strength training a day in my life. Always been more of a runner. I did push ups, jumping jacks and sit ups and cardio (running) Jan-Feb this year to start dropping some weight.
Picked up a lot of stuff from Bullyjuice on youtube on bodyweight exercises then created my own circuit based on a lot of the exercises I learned from his channel.
I also do my fair share of running.

Bodyweight routine Mon/Wed/Fri

iPad stopwatch to track times.

15 Chin Ups (about 30sec)
Ankle Taps - 60sec
Rest 30s

25 Push Ups (good form about 30 sec)
Crunches 60sec

Upright plank 1m25s

Elbow plank 1m25s
Crunches 30s

-this accounts for exactly 10 minutes altogether. I repeat this same circuit until I hit 40 minutes. I use to do this for 60 minutes (June-Dec) but for the last few weeks have been feeling a bit weaker so toned it down a notch to 40 minutes. After the 40 minutes I will still continue other sets like below

Just a variation of all this until I hit an hour or even a few minutes after. I do this Mon/Wed/Fri except for Fridays I only do 30-35 mins and a run after. 4-5 mile run. Pace depends on how I feel. Easy pace is 7mph, normal pace is 8mph, moderate is 9 and I sometimes do intervals where I will do 8, 9 and 10mph. Intervals vary.

I typically run 9 miles on Tuesday (typically faster paces), 8 miles on Thursday (typically a straight 8mph), 4-5 on Friday (interval speeds), Saturdays I will normally do a really fast run at 9mph for 6 mins then 60sec slower at 8mph then back up to 9 for another 6 mins until I hit 8 miles.
I usually will walk my dog Mon-Thurs 4-5miles at typically a 4mph pace.

All in all I feel like I am super active. I have a pretty physically demanding job doing highway guardrail. Some days are harder than others but I have yet to talk myself out of anyday of my routine.

My diet I never payed any attention to until around July 2021

I took a break from bodyweight training from March-June to try and drop weight faster so I did a lot more cardio during that time. Ever since the second week in June my routine has been pretty strict. Maybe missed maybe a day or 2 since only to let fresh tattoos heal up.

Some days I will do bodyweight training and run immediately after (I have a treadmill at home) but I will always take a quick break and eat a bowl of oatmeal with walnuts and a banana before I start my run as to try and avoid burning any sort of muscle. I also eat before I workout as well but that varies. Typically greek yogurt. Normally I have had breakfast, lunch and snacks during the day before I do my training so I don't worry much about eating before hand. If I do it's maybe a scoop of PB and a greek yogurt.

After I run my cooldown is typically walking the dog like I mentioned earlier.

Right now I'm just a little torn on what I'd like to do moving forward. Personally I'd like to go on a cut and drop more weight because I feel as if I picked up a fair amount of strength and muscle gains but am somewhat skinny fat so I feel like I need to get my BF% lower so I can actually physically see how hard I've worked this year.

Am I getting enough rest time? My workout feels pretty intense, that coupled with the running and walking I'm doing feels like a lot. Does the workout seem like too much or not enough?

Any comments/suggestions/critique welcome. 
I know I did touch base too hard on my diet but if anyone needs any of that detail I'm happy to provide some insight.

"Restarting Training, need some help/advice.","Its been a while since I posted in this subreddit. But over the last,4-6 months I’ve been recovering from an injury I sustained whilst playing football. After loads of rehab I’m back to being able to play competitively, although I’m probably at 70% match fitness. In the time I did not Calisthenics or any sort of resistance training. Now, since getting back to it and I’ve been doing the RR (Recommended Routine) for about 6 weeks, and I’ve progressed pretty quickly and I’m back to doing weighed pull ups and weighted dips. 

Over the time I was not training, I looked over my previous training and thought I’d change it up so I can learn to FL and Planche in 2022 - or at least get the FL by this time next year. I know the Planche is quite hard, so that may take 2 years at bare minimum. So I’m seeking some advice on programming and routine structure. I know Steve is planning to release an app sometime soon, but in the meantime I need some advice. My plan is to train towards my Calisthenic goals about 3x a week, with 1 or sessions of legs per week (depending on football ⚽️ training). So here is an outline of my plan after I do another two weeks of the RR.

Monday &amp; Friday 

1. Warm up and Mobility (15 mins) 
2. FL and Planche Statics 
3. FL Rows + PPPUs
4. Pull Ups + Pike Push Ups

Wednesday:

1. Warm up and Mobility (15 mins) 
2. FL and Planche Statics 
3. FL Raises + Tuck L-sit to Tuck Planche 
4. Bicep Isolation  + Shoulder/Tricep Isolation

One idea is too alternate each week which workout I do once or twice in that week.In the example above, I do Wednesdays workout on Monday &amp; Friday and take the former and do it on Wednesday. Changing it each week 

An alternative routine would be to have a Planche and FL day. 

Monday and Thursday:

1. Tuck Planche Hold (5-10 seconds) X4 2. Planche Lean (15 seconds) X4
3. Tuck L-Sit To Tuck Planche (5) X5
4. PPPUs (5) X5
5. Pike Push ups (6-10) X5

Tuesday and Friday: 

1. Tuck Front Lever Hold (5-10 seconds) X4 2. 2. Tuck Front Lever Raises (2-4) X4
3. FL Rows (1) X7
4. Pull Ups (5-8) X4
5. Hollow Body Hold (30sec) X4 and/or bicep isolation

Another alternative, instead of doing legs on a sperate days, is to throw in a maximum of 2 leg exercises at the end of each workout similar to how the RR has squats and RDLs. That way I can work on my Planche and FL training, whilst still making leg gains and leaving the other days to do more drill/technique based training for my soccer or focussing on improving my mobility (such as ankle mobility) which is terrible.

5. Hollow Body Hold (30sec) X4 and/or bicep isolation

Another alternative, instead of doing legs on a sperate days, is to throw in a maximum of 2 leg exercises at the end of each workout similar to how the RR has squats and RDLs. That way I can work on my Planche and FL training, whilst still making leg gains and leaving the other days to do more drill/technique based training for my soccer or focussing on improving my mobility (such as ankle mobility) which is terrible. 

Am I doing too much."

Help with mobility,"Hello guys, and a happy new year to everyone. 

So I’m just posting about help with mobility. Since I started Calisthenics, I’ve noticed I have very poor mobility, which has probably lead to some injuries. For example, I cannot for the life of me sit in deep squat due to poor ankle mobility. When I do the 5 inch wall test, my knee is probably about 2 inches away from touching the wall - basically need another 2inches of ankle mobility. In general I’m a stiff person, especially in my lower body. I play quite a bit of soccer, and I have noticed that I really struggle to hit high volleys (Zidane 2002 UCL final) cause of tight hips, and I really struggle with the L-sit cause of poor compression and possibly tight and weak hip flexors.

So I was wondering, are there any good mobility programs out there that you would recommend. I know there are channels like Tom Merrick on YouTube, but there is so much information out there that it’s a struggle to colate all of it and create a program that can help me. There’s even the kneesovertoes guy who’s program I’ve heard is good at helping people gain lower body mobility and strength.

All opinions/help is welcomed. And I hope you all have a great 2022 in regards to your fitness journey",0,"Help with mobilityHello guys, and a happy new year to everyone.

Is implementing weightlifting exercices a bad idea for someone practicing climbing and running ?,"Hello there, I'm not sure if it's the right sub to post this, so feel free to redirect me.

**Context: **

I'm a 23yo guy, been climbing for a few years, but always seeked a balanced type of physique. Thus I always end a climbing session with a full body workout, and I run on my off days. 
I recently read ""overcoming gravity"", and became even more interested in balancing my workouts. This book answered a lot of questions regarding bodyweight fitness. 

However by doing a few spartan races, I noticed, not surprisingly, that I struggled with weights. My legs shake a bit, and I don't feel very confident in these obstacles. I think of the spartan races as a recap of my overall fitness. So weighted obstacles being a big weakness, I thought that maybe implementing a few weightlifting exercices into my routine would help me fill this gap. I was thinking about deadlift, bench and maybe squats.

Now, **by no means do I want to be a world class climber, break running records or become a strongman.** I just want to be a balanced athlete, with no big weakness that could lead to injury. Weightlifting and bodyweight training as I see them are tools that could help me reach that goal.



So I was at a gym earlier today, this place has a great boulder area, as well as an area with multiple pull up bars, and also a few ""cages"" for weightlifting. Coaches there are either specialized in bodyweight training or weightlifting.
I climbed a bit, then went into a bodyweight workout, and then, as I felt still pretty fresh, asked a coach to help me learn the technique for deadlifts since I've never done those.
He basically said it was useless for my practice, and could even deteriorate my running and climbing game.

**Hence the question : is implementing weightlifting exercices a bad idea for someone trying to be balanced ?**",0,"Is implementing weightlifting exercices a bad idea for someone practicing climbing and running ?Hello there, I'm not sure if it's the right sub to post this, so feel free to redirect me.

"Got some question about my current bodyweight routine, any answer will be appreciated","Hi everyone, 23 yo male here. I had been lifting weights for 1 year,  then I decided to switch to Calisthenics. Actually, I’m not really  interested in skills and whatnot, just really like the old street  workout and keeping things simple. My main goal is to stay lean, in shape and healthy. Infact, I also do kickboxing 2/week and run a few miles 1/2/week.   
My current physique is the following (5'9""/143-147 lbs/no idea of the BF) [https://i.imgur.com/lJAesgx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lJAesgx.jpg)

I did the RR for a few months, although I was already able to do dips and pull-ups due to my weightlifting times. Right now I’m able to do about 12 slow pull-ups in a row and 20/22 dips. I’d like to share my adjusted routine with you all. It is based on 3 days a week, typically M/W/F.

Mon  
Push ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 decline, 1 diamond),  
Dips 3x8-12,  
Reverse flies 2x8-12,   
Pull ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 hammer, 1 chin up),    
Bodyrows 3x8-12 (regular grip)

Wed   
Push ups 5x8-12 (2 regular, 1 wide, 2 diamond),   
Dips 3x8-12,   
Pull ups  5x8-12 (2 regular, 1 neutral, 2 chin ups),   
Bodyrows 3x8-12 (on TRX),    
Supermans 2x8-12

Fri   
Push ups 4x8-12  (2 regular, 1 decline, 1 diamond),   
Dips 3x8-12,   
TRX reverse flies  2x8-12,   
Pull ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 hammer, 1 chin up),   
Bodyrows  3x8-12 (wide grip),   
Supermans 2x8-12

I usually do abs in the morning, 5/week, several different types.

I  might want to pair up some excercises like in the RR, haven’t decided  yet. I don’t weight my push ups, pull ups and dips, not into it. Each  excercise is performed bodyweight only. I don’t train legs anymore.  Don’t judge me: my lower body is way more developed than my upper one, because of both genetics and lot of soccer when I was younger. Plus, I already use legs when I kickbox.

1. I've tried to keep push and pull excercises really balanced, have I done the same with anterior and rear delts? I’m really aware of the issues unbalance can bring, and is the medial delt stimulated rather well with the reverse flies?
2. My chest has always been my lacking part, so I was thinking of supersetting 2 sets of pushups with cable crossovers: will it be too much volume to handle or will it be just fine? I’d do that only 2 days out of 3.

I’d like to share my adjusted routine with y’all. It is based on 3 days a week, typically M/W/F.

M 
Push ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 decline, 1 diamond),
Dips 3x8-12,
Reverse flies 2x8-12,
Pull ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 hammer, 1 chin up),
Bodyrows 3x8-12 (regular grip)

W
Push ups 5x8-12 (2 regular, 1 wide, 2 diamond),
Dips 3x8-12,
Pull ups 5x8-12 (2 regular, 1 neutral, 2 chin ups),
Bodyrows 3x8-12 (on TRX),
Supermans 2x8-12

F
Push ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 decline, 1 diamond),
Dips 3x8-12,
TRX reverse flies 2x8-12,
Pull ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 hammer, 1 chin up),
Bodyrows 3x8-12 (wide grip),
Supermans 2x8-12

I usually do abs in the morning, 5/week, several different types. 

I might want to pair up some excercises like in the RR, haven’t decided yet. I don’t weight my push ups, pull ups and dips, not into it. Each excercise is performed bodyweight only. 
I don’t train legs anymore. Don’t judge me: my lower body is way more developed than my upper one, because of both genetics and lot of soccer when I was younger. Plus, I already use them when I kickbox. 

1. I tried to keep push and pull excercises really balanced, did I do the same with anterior and rear delts? I’m really aware of the issues that unbalance can bring, and is the medial delt stimulated rather well with the reverse flies?

2. My chest has always been my lacking part, so I was thinking of supersetting 2 sets of pushups with cable crossovers: will it be too much volume to handle or will it be just fine? I’d do that only 2 days out of 3. 

Thank you in advance and happy new year!"

Program critique please,"So, I asked a friend of mine who does a lot of bodyweight, to give me a weekly schedule which can, in theory, make me stronger, faster, and more agile for parkour and similar activities including jumping high, sprinting short distances, etc. and he gave me this one:

**DAY 1:**  

Tri-Set One: Push Ups(3x20)- Jumping Lunges(3x20)- L-Sit Hold(3x30”)

Tri-Set Two:Dips(3×15)-Hanging Knee Raises(3×15)-Half Burpees(3×10)

Tri-Set Three: Chin Ups(3×10)-Sit Ups(3×20)-Glute Bridges(3×10)

**DAY 2:**

Tri-Set One: Wide to Close Push Ups(3×20)-Wide to Close Squats(3×20)-Supermans(3×30”)

Tri-Set Two: Tricep Extensions(3×12)-Reverse Crunches(3x20)-Inch Worms(3×10)

Tri-Set Three: Pull Ups(3×10)-Toes to Bar(3×20)-Alternating Pistol Squats(3×10)

**DAY 3:**

Tri-Set One: Decline Push Ups(3×20)-Box Jumps(3×10)-Hollow Hold(3×30”)

Tri-Set Two: Plank to Push Ups(3×15)-Bicycle Crunches(3×30)-Flutter Kicks(3×50)

Tri-Set Three: Wide Grip Pull Ups(3×10)-Wall Climbs(3×20)-Plank Hold(3xFailure)

&amp;#x200B;

Each one of these days is accompanied by a warm up run (I plan on running 20-30'). In between these, he said I could either do endurance cardio, mobility or martial arts and keep it 5-6 days a week.

I want to know your opinion as well. 

Is it good in terms of specificity, or just a generic program he gave me, to get rid of me (possible scenario!) ? 

What changes can I do to make it better for my goal?

Gtg burpees x chin ups or pull ups challenge for the new year.,"For those who have the time, here's the deal.

The burpees is one pump meaning.  Go to plank position, do one push up.  Go to standing position and jump as high as you can.  That's one rep.

Do this for 12 seconds as fast as you can in good form.

Then go straight to do 1-2+ chin up or pull up.  You mustn't go to failure.  Leave something in the tank.

Then rest for as long as you need.  But do this 4-8 x within the day.

My suggestion is before and after each meal.  You can spend one minute total doing this or less.  So you end up with 6 sets easy.

Caveat.  If you find you feel the performance diminished within the day where you cant do it as intense.  Stop.  Next day awaits.

Also if you can't do a burpee or chinups or pull up.

Go for knee raises push up and inverted rows.

If you can't do any of these, go for walking atleast 10 minutes before and after meals.  That should net you 1 hour of walking in a day.

Try to do this for atleast 30 days.  But take rest if you feel you should.  And if you can't do it on a certain day because of work etc..it's fine.

But I do hope you take the challenge.  This could be the workout you'll be doing for the rest of your life. Or atleast be a good foundation.

Tldr

Circuit Variation

1 pump burpee and pull up

Squat thrust, push up and inverted row

Body weight squats, push up, inverted row

Knee raises and push ups

Walking

You can also do your own circuit.  But remember, no going to failure.  Spread the sets in the day.  First sign of diminishing performance stop for the day.",0,"Gtg burpees x chin ups or pull ups challenge for the new year.For those who have the time, here's the deal.

"Need a good Workout Plan for the New Year, Mostly Bodyweight","Where do I even start lol. I’m 16 years old, male, and weigh 150lbs. I’m have a “Skinny-Fat” physique. So I’ve been trying to get back into fitness recently, and I’ve decided that starting on the 1st I will start working out every day and try to reach my “dream physique” by the end of May. I have a lot of resolutions I plan to keep throughout the new year, and so I’m really trying to keep my motivation up and make it to may with that goal in mind. My dream physique is an overall more defined and built muscles all around, as well as a six pack( if that’s possible lol). I got skinny forearms and calves that I’m really self conscious about, so I really want to bulk those up too. Last year I was really skinny, I weighed 80lbs and was a twig. I dirty bulked up to 150, and I worked out up until school started, which I then stopped and my physique that I gained was gone, as well as the ability to do normal workouts like push ups and pull ups. Now that I’m planning on starting to workout again, I need help finding a workout program that’ll get me to my goal by the end of may. I have 10,15,20,&amp;25 lbs weights, a pull-up bar, a strong resistance and that I can use, along with multiple grip strengtheners. I know the first thing in getting fit is diet, so eating healthy and tracking my calories is something I already hav planned out, but I still need a workout plan. Rn I’m thinking of trying out Igor voitenkos plans, but I really need something that’ll help me reach my goals by the end of may. I like planning things out and knowing what workouts I’m gonna do in advance, bc it is overall easier for me to stick to something if I already have a plan.

Alternatives to crunches.," Hey guys,

I started my fitness journey by doing 100 crunches and 2 sets of 45 sec plank. After the first day, my back was sore and it would hurt whenever I would bend to pick up something from the floor/ground. Idk why that is so I did some research on google and there was a harvad study that elucidated that crunches can make your back sore. Then I saw some alternatives to crunches that are easier on your back. However, there are so many people who do crunches every day without worrying about back pain. What do you guys think is the reason for my back pain?. Should I stop doing crunches?.

Thank you.",0,"Alternatives to crunches. Hey guys,

This will be in my new website about holistic health:,"I would love some input:

""Intense Exercise including resistance exercise, weights, HIIT, calisthenics, and cardio could be the best holistic health practice ever,  by a wide margin.  Unfortunately too many people don't do the **intensity** part.  Most people can build a lot of health strength this way.  Intense exercise is actually more efficient  at triggering autophagy and apoptosis than fasting.

""There is definitely a ""too little"" and a ""too much"" when it comes  to intense exercise.  See the section about Hormesis.  Build gradually,  but don't be afraid of a little pain,  especially sore muscles.  Build your determination so that you  celebrate when you get to an authentic **failure**, when you simply  can't push or pull any longer.  Sometimes when I ""fail"" doing push-ups, my arms are so tired and so weak that I have to  roll over on my side and use my elbows to get up, while chuckling to  myself at what a victory that was.  Don't shy away from very long rest periods during the day.  The point of HIIT  (**H**igh **I**ntensity **I**nterval **T**raining, the best  way to exercise) is that you can put everything into your exercise.  Easy cardio is better than nothing,  but it does not qualify as intense exercise.  Intensity is the secret.  Intense exercise is insanely good for one's willpower, about on par with cold showers. 	   [ Dr. Peter Attia, MD on Joe Rogan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kYDVjX0G0)  Peter tells us in this podcast that intense exercise is the single best  'drug' for health and longevity. 	   	

""I actually spend very little time exercising.  I would guess  that perhaps 20 minutes per day, scattered all across the day.  But  those 20 minutes are down right heroic, like 100 push-ups in less than 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I  am resting.  Without adequate recovery, lots of people fail to progress.   I can't tell you how many young people I've seen on YouTube who complain that they aren't getting the  gains that they were hoping for, when they do 100 push-ups (or more)  every day.  They aren't giving themselves time to recover.  If your muscles still hurt, then rest.   This isn't rocket science.  It **IS** being excessively yang,  pushing one's self too hard and not allowing for recovery, which is an inherently yin or parasympathetic process.   No one should do intensity on the same muscle group day after day after  day.  Every other day is quite  sufficient. 	   	

""The new punishment for sloth is no longer eternal damnation.  It is now painful disease and an early death.

The point of HIIT  (**H**igh **I**ntensity **I**nterval **T**raining, the best  way to exercise) is that you can put everything into your exercise.  Easy cardio is better than nothing,  but it does not qualify as intense exercise.  Intensity is the secret.  Intense exercise is insanely good for one's willpower, about on par with cold showers. 	   [ Dr. Peter Attia, MD on Joe Rogan.](  Peter tells us in this podcast that intense exercise is the single best  'drug' for health and longevity. 	   	

""I actually spend very little time exercising.  I would guess  that perhaps 20 minutes per day, scattered all across the day.  But  those 20 minutes are down right heroic, like 100 push-ups in less than 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I  am resting.  Without adequate recovery, lots of people fail to progress.   I can't tell you how many young people I've seen on YouTube who complain that they aren't getting the  gains that they were hoping for, when they do 100 push-ups (or more)  every day.  They aren't giving themselves time to recover.  If your muscles still hurt, then rest.   This isn't rocket science.  It **IS** being excessively yang,  pushing one's self too hard and not allowing for recovery, which is an inherently yin or parasympathetic process.   No one should do intensity on the same muscle group day after day after  day.  Every other day is quite  sufficient.

Requesting routine critique,"Hey guys, I just wanted some critique on my routine (made it myself).
For reference, I'm a 17 year old male, 166cm, 63kg. My current goal is strength, with hypertrophy as an added bonus, I guess. My routine is structured like so. Four days of workouts in a week, with Tuesday, Friday and Saturday off. I do a straight arm - bent arm split, with leg work added onto straight arm days. 

Workout 1 - Sun/ Wed:
Warmup + Stretching
15 minutes skill work (Handstand and L-sit to V-sit progression) 

[Back lever progression (5-30s)
210s rest] × 3 

[Front lever progressiob (5-30s)
150s rest
Planche progression (5-30s)
150s rest] × 3 

[Anterior chain movement (Pistol/Shrimp squats) (4-10 reps)
120s rest
Posterior chain movement (Deadlifts/ Reverse Nordic curl) (4-10 reps)
120s rest] × 3 

Workout 2 - Mon/ Thu:
Warmup + Stretching
15 minutes skill work (Handstand and L-sit to V-sit progression) 

[One arm pull up progression (4-10 reps)
120s rest
Handstand pushup progression (4-10 reps)
120s rest] × 3 

[Muscle up progression (4-10 reps)
120s rest
Dip progression (4-10 reps)
120s rest] × 3 

[Front lever pull up progression (4-10 reps)
120s rest
Planche pushup progression (4-10 reps)
120s rest] × 3 

So, I have a few questions regarding my routine selection 

1: Do you think I should have more training days in a week? Like 5 days, split like 1/2/1/2/1 - rest 2 days - 2/1/2/1/2 - rest 2 days. Or maybe even 6 days a week? 

2: Should I have some focused core work in the routine? I think I'm hitting the core quite well with everything I'm doing, but maybe add in some extra work? 

3: If I am adding in core work, should I reduce the load on the bent arm day by taking out one vertical pull and push movement so it becomes 2 pairs, which then gives room for the core work?",0,"Requesting routine critiqueHey guys, I just wanted some critique on my routine (made it myself).

Will 100 push-ups every day actually build muscle?,"About 7 years ago, I didn’t have access to a gym and naturally started bodyweight training. I was that skinny Asian kid and wanted to get big. So I started doing 100 push ups every morning. I was told it would change my life…. Here are the results:

After month 1, I started noticing some definition in my pecs. It was a massive struggle reaching 100 every day but I wasn’t going to give up. After month 2, my chest definitely looked visibly bigger - but I was actually surprised to see my arms and shoulders looked a lot bigger too. After month 3, the workout became a lot easier and I couldn’t believe how much stronger I had become. The speed of my upper body growth was honestly insane to me. There’s me thinking I needed a gym to get big!

So back to present day, I decided to create my own version of a 100 push up workout. It contains 10 different push up variations, targeting different parts of your chest, so I think it’s better (and more varied) than just doing 100 regular push ups. I honestly think this will help some people out there trying to build muscle for the first time. I know it did for me. 

Hope you find it helpful, and would love to get some feedback on the YouTube channel too!

Body Shaking during workout,Is this normal?! (35 f) in the past year I've lost 60 lbs. I haven't lost any weight in the past 2 months. So recently maybe 3 weeks now I started you tube HIIT and strength and body weight videos every morning . Usually 30 mins long. I haven't been able to keep up with the person doing the video but I give it my all. Have even added some 10 or 15 lb weights in sometimes. So I guess I have 2 questions. Does anyone shake? Like whatever part of the body I'm working out after a few reps I'm shaking. Or am I just that bad out of shape? Lol also did anyone just stop losing weight when they started adding weights into their workout? Before when I started to lose weight I only dieted and walked. When I got up to 4 mile walks I haven't lost any more but haven't gained. Sorry if this post is long. I've only been on here a short time and this is my first post. 🙂,0,Body Shaking during workoutIs this normal?! (35 f) in the past year I've lost 60 lbs.

I can’t do push-ups.,"I’m a 14 year old female, 165cm tall and I weigh around 60kg. I have never worked out my arms, even though I dabbled with cardio for a while and I felt motivated to start. I quickly realized that I can’t do one push-up, which wasn’t a big deal at first since this was expected. Though I can barley do one knee push-up either (which I had before), I’ve been working out with a focus on my arms for about two weeks now and I see no results. When I searched for advice, there were only answers from dudes, and they basically said to do just push-ups? 

My current workout is:
-5-10chair dips (though I experience quite a bit of pain in my shoulders)
-30sec to 1min hunters pose
-10 squats
-30 incline push-ups against a kitchen counter
-15-20 seconds push-up position
-5 half-push-ups
-10 half knee push-ups
-30 sec plank
-3 leg lifts
-10 sit-ups
And I repeat this most often twice, but sometimes three times. I work out every other day, sometimes two days in a row.
I finish it off with 15 minutes on a stationary bike, with the last 5 going all in.

"Every time I start exercising, my sleep gets ruined. How can I fix this?","Few days ago I posted here that I’m interested in starting a body weight routine and looking forward to starting soon. I got some satisfying answers but the there’s one thing I need to figure out how to fix before I start. 

Few months ago I went to the gym and started lifting again after not going for a year and a half. Now note that I’ve always been a couch potato. Constant gaming and film watching. 24 years old , 6’4 ft fall btw. I’ve never been constant at the gym mostly because of college , which I already graduated from. 

When I started lifting, my sleep went to complete shit. I normally sleep 12:30 to 7:30 p.m. sometimes until 8:30. I strongly cherish my sleep, mainly because in my late teens, early 20s I struggled with sleeping. Falling asleep has never even an issue but staying asleep for 7-8 hours was. I would sleep at 12 then wake up a 4 or 5 and couldn’t fall back asleep for another 2-3 hours, leading to being late a work and such. Thankfully now I have better sleeping habits.

But when I started exercising I went back to that shitty sleeping habit.I worked out on a Monday, fell asleep at 12 and woke up at 5:30. Couldn’t fall back asleep. At all. Tuesday I work out again and it was even worse cause I woke up at 4 in the morning that night. Felt like complete shit so I didn’t workout that day. And it that sleeping pattern continued until Sunday. I stopped working out after Tuesday but the sleeping pattern continued. It’s like my body is so used to be fucking lazy that it rejected fucking exercising or something. 

Some have said it’s because I worked out in the evening but that wouldn’t make sense because like I said it continued even on days I didn’t work out. Monday night things went back to normal thankfully and I haven’t exercised since. This happened to me last summer as well. 

What is the issue and how can I fix it? I’m sure it’s like some hormone/adrenaline thing because guess what, when spider man no way home came out, I was fucking excited for the movie and anxious id be spoiled for it that I woke up at 4:30 am and couldn’t fall back asleep at all either.

Pike push ups in RR,"Hi!

I am doing the RR, and would like to start working towards the wall-supported handstand push-ups (new year resolution... :))

I am doing handstand as part of my skill work, before the strength work, every workout.

I would also like to start doing pike push ups to build the strength towards handstands. However, I am not sure where to place them in the RR. They are not skill-only, and they do not seem to be focusing on the chest as much as ring pushups or pseudo-planche (please correct me if I am wrong!). 

The only idea is to replace dips (I am at 3*8 there, 3*6 if I use rings).

What would you suggest?

Handstand Journey Plateau - Any Help/Tips Would Be Much Appreciated,"Hi,

I've been practicing handstands for about a year - 4 days a week. The routine is quite simple - 8 minutes of practicing balance and form using walls and 2 minutes of practicing free-standing handstands. With all that said, I just can't seem to balance it constantly and can do it for 2-3 seconds on average (the strength part of a handstand isn't the problem). I think my form is decent and also, I know how to use my fingers for body repositioning. With heck of a lot videos watched on this subject and much more failed attempts of handstands, I've gotten really frustrated since my progress is non-existent.

So here I am asking you guys for any tip on how to balance a handstand that had helped you in your journey. Thanks in advance :)",0,"Handstand Journey Plateau - Any Help/Tips Would Be Much AppreciatedHi,

Can't pull myself up from a dead hang. Help me progress.,"I'm trying to get my first proper pull up (never done one). I tried to improve my incline rows (as regression), trained for a month and doubled my max (now 22).  
I noticed while I still can't do a pull up from a dead hang, if my elbows are bent about 30 degrees I can complete the rest of the movement (door pullup bar is low so my feet can touch).  
Now to progress from here, I've thought of:

1. continuing with incline rows
2. doing pullup reps starting with my elbows bent about 30 degrees
3. buying some resistance bands and try to lift myself up from a dead hang

I've already tried scapular pulls and negative pullups but I don't really feel they work for me (dislike the movement and find myself being inconsistent while training them).

Gymnastics Metod (Adam Godrosi) anyone have any experience?,"Hi everyone

I'm over a year following RR. My progress is very good. I'm reached, the point where I have to decide what to do next. I'm mostly  on advanced exercises and RR routine make me very tired. It was excellent until now. I do currently 15kg dips ,20 kg flat possition rows ,85 kg squat ( I can do more ,but don't wanna progress here at the moment) , normal pull-ups ( straggling here to get more volume),65 kg Romanian deadlift ,85 kg deadlift, nearly full pseudoplanche pushups.  I do either find new program or do some adjustments to RR routine. I have been searching for programs. The most I like is Fitnessfaq ,but then I found information about gymnastics method from Adam Godrosi. I would like ask if someone doing this program or have done in past. I will appreciate any advice how to adjust RR to make further progress and not dying after workout. Maybe longer brakes between sets? I don't know. Of course I will appreciate advice on any other good program there with good references. My main goal is have very strong core to avoid back pain which I didn't have since starting RR. It's excellent program I would like to continue ,but I'm without power on last exercises.(weighted rows , following by pseudoplanche pushups are proper killers). I do own the OG2 book as well ,but I have absolutely no time to reading it properly and study. I do work 80 hours a week and I just wanna follow some programs three times a week max 1:30 min. I don't have more time.

Anyone tried full body Greasing the Groove?,"I'm curious if anyone has tried a greasing the groove style approach but for the whole body rather than just one exercise?

I work from home, have all the equipment I need and have plenty of time on my hands. So I could easily do each exercise one per hour. I could even separate out the 2 upper and lower body exercises eg: Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, (wait 30 mins), Dips, Kettlebell Swings, (wait 30 mins), repeat.  

I’d also do some light cardio after work just once a day, taking rest days from this as needed.

Greasing the groove saved me (34M) post surgery.,"WARNING: long read. So almost a year ago now I went into surgery for multiple injuries to my bicep and shoulder. It all started as a result of a 10 year old workplace injury, but as time marched on it led to more issues. I got bicep tenodesis surgery, shoulder labrum surgery, and had my collar bone shaved so they could clean up my ACL along with the bursas drained.  

Frankly, post surgery was awful. I’ll save you those details. It’ll suffice to say when I was cleared to start working out regularly (after following my physical therapy to a T) I did. But I was so embarrassed at my strength. I left the gym one day and cried in my car because of how weak I became compared to others. I couldn’t go back.

The toughest part was losing pull ups, my favorite exercise. I majorly struggled with pull ups, one because all that upper body strength was gone, but two because mentally I felt I couldn’t start over again. And then, as if a light bulb turned on, I remembered greasing the groove. 

So that’s what I did. I started hanging from the bar a few times a day. Shit, even that took work. Then I’d attempt one pull up. Then two. Then three. Then four. And so on. Knowing I wasn’t going anywhere near failure gave me the space to accept my weakness, because I knew I’d just try again later. And it felt so easy, so accessible, that not only was that mental block gone, but the strength to do full pull ups bounced right back. 

I still have some issues. Push ups are taking a long time to recover. And some exercises still feel funny. But without greasing the groove, I don’t know if I’d ever have gotten the confidence back to just…try. 

So with that said, thanks. I don’t know where I’d be without such a simple concept. 

TL;dr: GTG helped my recovery",0,"Greasing the groove saved me (34M) post surgery.WARNING: long read. So almost a year ago now I went into surgery for multiple injuries to my bicep and shoulder. It all started as a result of a 10 year old workplace injury, but as time marched on it led to more issues. I got bicep tenodesis surgery, shoulder labrum surgery, and had my collar bone shaved so they could clean up my ACL along with the bursas drained.

Calisthenics + Weights Workout Routine Push/Pull/Legs,"I've loved incorporating calisthenics into my workout routine. When I train calisthenics, I feel better, less aches, and more confident about my mobility. My strength is also more symmetrical. Gymnastic rings are my favorite workout tools. But, weights and machines have a very important role in strength and fitness. In my case, I feel like weights add more mass, as it is usually easier to progressively overload. They are also very useful in isolating muscle groups.

I wanted to create a workout routine that mixes traditional bodybuilding principles and excercises, while also adding calisthenics. The goal for this routine is muscular hypertrophy. In the past, I've used calisthenic skills for warmups, and have seen very good results as long as I don't overdo it. The volume for this routine is relatively high, as I am an intermediate lifter/athlete. 

As of right now, I have a shoulder injury (calcification in my rotator cuff), which worsens with heavy bench press exercises. Ring chest excercises feel great though. So, I am limiting my bench press exercises. 

The routine is a Push/Pull/Legs split. I use bands for the warmup/skill portions.

My progression over the year 2021,"So I am a teenager who was merely overweight. I used to weight around 83 kg. At the start of 2021 I decided to make a change and so I did I started working out at home very minimally. I was dropping weight. I was only doing cardio and not resistance training. Throught my journey until October I lost roughly 20 kg. But as I toned down my body fat percentage I quickly realized that I should start training for muscle growth. So I started doing calisthenics at home and also started bulking( eating in a surplus) Since then I gained 2 kg of weight( mainly muscle). But I do not really see the changes I want, I actually see very minimal changes and that frustrates and upsets me. Sometime when I workout I feel weaker than the last workout, so my motivation is running low. So I wanted to ask this community for tips, maybe you can help me.
Also this is my routine: 

Upper body day #1: Monday
Warmup
Frogstand progression 
L-sit progression
Pushups
Dips
Diamond pushups 
Skull crushers
Pike pushups
Inverted Rows
Pullups
Chinups 

Lower body day #1: Tuesday( here I also add a little bit of weight)

"Request for Suggested Reps to Achieve Fitness Goal - 60 Push-Ups, 60 Sit-Ups, 1.5 mile run in 10 mins","I participate in an annual fitness assessment and my aim this year is to achieve 60 push-ups in a minute, 60 sit-ups in a minute, and a 1.5 mile run in 10 mins. In designing my fitness plan to achieve this I was hoping for some advice on the reps I should target for each set in my workouts.

Below is my plan, any help and advice is greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

PUSH-UPS

I aim to do 5 sets of 20 push-ups as a benchmark to know that I'm ready to do 60 in a single set. Is this an advisable number of reps? My plan is to do 5 sets of push-ups every day, increasing the reps every week until I achieve the desired number.

&amp;#x200B;

SIT-UPS

I understand that planks are the way to do in order to develop core strength. With this in mind, how should I adapt my daily exercises to achieve the goal of 60 sit-ups in a single set? Is the goal perhaps 5 sets of 2 minute planks?

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone should stretch,"I see people having a hard time reaching the floor, pain in the back, or in other parts of their body.  This is because of the facias Notting up.

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/muscle-pain-it-may-actually-be-your-fascia

Cited a reference for the source and my solution is stretching in addition to your exercise routine.

Here's the routine

1. Do your breath work, for me that's 8 breathes of wimhof.

2. Isometric warm up the muscle area. Like do static squats or push up or chin up.  (Ive always done stretching after exercise as cool down)

3. Then do the stretch and hold it for atleast 20 seconds.  You can work you way by progression by adding seconds to hold x position till 1-2 minutes.

Question can you stretch everyday?

Yes.  Just make sure to warm up the muscle. So you don't injure yourself.

Is bouncing ok?

No.  Because if you're not yet flexible, doing so may lessen your flexibility or injure yourself.

Is dynamic stretching ok?

Yes. But it's not what I promote because if you're new to stretching, you may hurt yourself.

Sample routine I do.

1. Wake up
2. Do the day's exercise (deload or workout)
3. Wimhof breaths 8 reps per stretch.
4. Cold shower
5. Breakfast work etc.

Important data points:

1. Exercises. I have a simple library of the exercises I do, with video references. 

2. Sets. Sets include the # reps, modifiers, progressions, videos, related to Exercises and Goals. 

3. Goals. All of what I do is related to strength and skill goals like a 3 second open hip straddle planche, 15 second front lever, and 1 stalder press handstand. 

4. Program. All of the goals I go after and sets that I do are in 6-8 week cycles. A program shows the 4 days a week of exercises that I plan to perform.

---

Typically I set out a program and on some days I do what I set out. Sometimes I modify based on how I'm feeling. Some sets I record reps, others only video. Sometimes I exercise with a goal in mind, sometimes I'm being playful. All said, I built this and tweaked it until it was flexible to handle all the scenarios I find myself in. 

I would love your feedback. I would love to see your your fitness tracking methods.

3. Goals. All of what I do is related to strength and skill goals like a 3 second open hip straddle planche, 15 second front lever, and 1 stalder press handstand. 

4. Program. All of the goals I go after and sets that I do are in 6-8 week cycles. A program shows the 4 days a week of exercises that I plan to perform.

---

Typically I set out a program and on some days I do what I set out. Sometimes I modify based on how I'm feeling. Some sets I record reps, others only video. Sometimes I exercise with a goal in mind, sometimes I'm being playful. All said, I built this and tweaked it until it was flexible to handle all the scenarios I find myself in. 

I would love your feedback. I would love to see your your fitness tracking methods. 

Training happy 💪🙂"

Experienced trainers: How should I choose between RDL and Nordic Curl for my strength routine?,"Also, if I were to include both, how can I do so?

I plan on strength training with my Olympic dumbbell handles, strongman-designed sandbags, and adjustable kettlebell (12kg to 32kg).

My goal is to get strong for overall life situations (ie: helping to move things, survival, etc), as well as participate in everyday life, hobbies (baseball leagues) and learning materials arts.  

My plan is to use the recommendation routine from the bodyweight Fitness subreddit for upper body, while using my dumbbells, sandbag and/or adjustable kettlebell for legs and posterior chain. The concern is that I don’t know how to incorporate each tool into my program.

A major concern of mine is that when I competed in high school and college years for baseball, I frequently got hamstring injuries when running the bases, so I know that’s a weakness of mine that I wanna avoid. I hear that RDL isn’t enough to mitigate hamstring injuries, but Nordic Curls and GHR are more effective.

Improving body rows,"\[absolute beginner here\]

Situation: I can do one set (8 reps) of body rows with my legs straight. And then I take a 2 min break - and try to do the 2nd set but cant go beyond 5-6. Subsequent sets are worse and I try to get to 8 reps each set by bending my legs and reducing the length of my outstretched body.

I've been stuck at this for about 6 weeks now - but I know I've progressed in some other aspects (like I can 2 band assisted pull ups with proper form, previously I couldnt do even one)

Is there a way to understand if this is normal? Am I being impatient? Maybe I am, but I dont have much of a reference point on how slow/fast progressions should be. 

I'm obese, 5'9'' and 204lbs. My diet is I'd say around 80-90% controlled. I used to 220lbs a few months ago - so at least something is working in my diet.",0,"Improving body rows\[absolute beginner here\]

Minimalists unite! What's your minimalist routine?,"I'm a firm believer of ""mental sustainability"" for long-term success; so many people go through a ""beastmode"" phase of their lives where they hit the gym/workouts hard, to the max, then ultimately just burnout. Seeing an extended laundry list of movements in a routine is such a turnoff for me. Considering the large of muscles compound movements hit, I never felt it necessary to have such a long list. My own:

- Chinups:  Narrow-grip/hollowbody. I've completely stopped doing pullups in favor of chins. At the very last rep of a set, I hold at the very top to allow the biceps/core put in some extra work. Try it! These builds some pretty awesome abs. 

- Dips: Often with 35lbs between the legs. It's fun knowing that my pecs which I've been complimented on in a few occasions were built using my mom's plastic medical walker. It sits in my room since it takes up practically no space so I can crank out some reps on a complete whim; convenient, amazing.

- Legs: Got me here. I'm lazy in this department. Sometimes it's goblet squats, air squats, BSS. Finally mastering the pistol squat so this may be my new lazy movement here, in between my occasional hikes.

- ETC: Kettlebells. Walmart had some on the cheap earlier in the year so I'll occasionally do a few cleans/rows, whatever. Just some random spontaneous movements for functional strength building. 

That's pretty much it. Not the most exciting routine but it keeps me consistent for sure.",0,"Minimalists unite!

Endurance training on off days,"This is a question that's already been asked multiple times but with exercises that still feel like you are doing strength or volume training rather than endurance.

In my case I'd like to train on off days just for the sake of increasing numbers. Right now I can do about 8 HSPU per 4 sets, today I checked and I can only do 36 normal push ups which is not really that much compared to before I started doing calisthenics. With calisthenics my strength and hypertrophy gains are notorious but it seems I didn't improve in the endurance aspect.

My primary goal is strength and progressing on calisthenics movements (currently pursuing planche and front lever) and endurance comes second.

So, doing something like 2x35 reps of push ups on off days just for the sake of, one day, being able to do 50 reps interfere with my current strength progress? I'm an office worker, I pass 8hr/day in front of the computer and I don't really do any kind of exercise other than my strength routine 3 times a week.",0,"Endurance training on off daysThis is a question that's already been asked multiple times but with exercises that still feel like you are doing strength or volume training rather than endurance.

Adding HIIT / Spinning to RR for muscle building,"Hi,

I have a few questions to add HIIT / Spinning to my Workout plan.

1) i consider adding small 15min full Body HIIT Session after the RR. Does this have a bad Influence on building muscles? By Google i just find to not to it before/to long but no real scientific answers. Does is maybe even help?

2) should i / can i do longer HIIT (30-40 min) workouts on the between days or does this too destroy my aim to build muscles?
i love Team HIIT trainings with a heartbeat sensor with aim to stay above 80% max heart rate and only drop below in the resting times

3) how about spinning classes with the same structure - Intervall Units with getting max heart rate 80-95% max?

How bad it is to do only pushing exercises in calisthenics?,"It is often said that one should balance the training between pushing and pulling exercises.

But what are exactly the consequences of an imbalance, especially doing almost only pushing? Can it be a real issue or is it just a matter of preferences? Or maybe, this push/pull method is too simple and reality is more complex?

***How do I put on weight overall without putting myself at risk of cardiac issues from my cholesterol?***

Yes I eat a lot; as much as I can - I carbload before big rides and I eat plenty of protein (that'll reduce a bit in the new year for cholesterol purposes). I don't eat much fruit because it's so expensive here but I eat a good amount of veg. I've been recommended by my GP to not use protein supplements because I'm still growing so that's not an option.

How to program for weighted pullups and pushups,"Hi,

So just some info on me to begin with. 175cm ~70kg and 22M. Been training with the rr for almost a year now. Went from 0 pullups to 12 solid reps on rings and from 12 really poor pushups to 20 pushups with solid form. I'm looking to start training with adding weight to these movements. But seeing as I have no experience with traditional strength training I'm not really sure how to program this.

I was thinking of doing a ppl split so that on each upper day I can focus all my energy into the weighted movement + some accessories. 

I was thinking something like this for the workouts.

Push: Weighted pushups, db ohp, some tricep isolation and additional shoulder work. (Lu raises and external rotation exercises)

Pull: Weighted pullups. Ring face pulls, ring rows, bicep curls, some forearm isolation too. Probably reverse wrist curls and finger curls.

For reps and sets, I know what to do for the accessories. It's the weighted movements I'm unsure of. I plan on starting with 5kgs on each movement and seeing how it feels. But beyond that I'm not sure. Any advice would be appreciated!!",0,"How to program for weighted pullups and pushupsHi,

Shredded by September after surgery?,"Hey all, hope everyone is having a great holiday. 

I've lurked here for a bit and have done a fair amount of my own research before starting the Recommended Routine. Unfortunately, right when I was getting into it in the fall (had a lot of time off while transitioning jobs) I ruptured my Achilles. 

Recovery has been slow and steady and I can put some weight on the leg now, but I think in general I'll be taking sports or anything with explosive movements off the table for 2022 until I get the confidence in my agility back. 

I'd like to get back into the Recommended Routine, with the caveat being that even exercises that don't directly exercise the leg still involve it in some way (getting up to or down from the pull up bar, contact with ground for push-ups, etc).

Of course I'll be talking to my physical therapist about ramping up my activity level, but I wanted to see if this sub had any thoughts too as it generally seems to be one of the most helpful and supportive places I lurk on this website.

Bodyweight chest,"As a skinny dude I've always wanted a chest. Despite that, my priorities in fitness are efficiency and convenience.

I started in bodyweight by doing some pushups throughout the day. Even after reaching high reps I noticed hardly any visible muscles. I tried diamonds and other variations in hand placement. The minor changes brought minor rewards. Decline pushups could help but the slight inversion, deltoid requirement, and variables in feet/hips/hand/head placement kills the fun without enough chest reward.

So, I bought some straps and tried flys only to quit early for a few reasons. Flys require straight arm strength to be effective while not necessarily helping to establish that strength. This means I would have to gain a capability that I don't quite value before I might be able to perform an isolated movement. Secondly, the ROM for flys is absurd compared to other movements such as a pushup. The arms can either spread beyond their working limit or they can narrow to a point of imbalance. Sure these are avoidable but again the cost is high for an isolated movement. Lastly, I see it as an ineffective attempt to replicate a gym machine so that more people buy straps.

Eventually I wandered into a gym routine and experimented with total body fitness. I decided to work on dips starting with bench, then bands at the dip station, then varied positioning at the station. Then I moved to the rings for support holds, then negatives, then my first few shaky red-faced ring dips.

With only a small volume those ring dips were grinding through my shoulders, so I started warming up with shoulder dislocates. Just like flys, the ROM was silly and the movement felt too isolated to be effective.
Everything changed when I started Skin the Cats. Versus shoulder dislocates I was getting a more effective warmup in a fraction of the time. If I focused on keeping my legs straight and slowing the movement then I would also get some chest pump, specifically when exiting the German Hang.

STC let me safely increase my ring dip volume. I was mainly seeing tricep and stabilizer activation but not enough chest.  I tried targeting my chest by ""leaning forward"" based on internet advice. However, I felt no real difference and my form was suffering. When I returned to strictly vertical form the depth in my range of motion began to increase. Beyond 5 reps at maximum depth (hands to armpits) my chest was finally getting pumped.
Based on my personal experience I think there is a common misunderstanding around the role of the pectorals. The lower pecs, larger than the upper, are used to move the elbows from behind the back to beside the ribs. Both STC and full-depth ring dips include this motion.

By only working the lower pecs I was effectively growing moobs. The space halfway between my collarbone and my nipple remained unfilled. I was still happy to have something but the longing for that complete chest persisted.

For some upcoming travel, I wanted a program that required less gear. Without my beloved rings I needed something for the upper body other than an excessive amount of gimmicky pushups.

I prefer bodyweight fitness for mobility and a habit that can be independent of weights. Without adding weight and without ROM limitations like ""wide"" variants, bodyweight progression requires unilateral movement. I already use split squats and archer rows, so what's the unilateral variant of a travel-friendly upper body compound exercise?

I started doing archer pushups and I feel the same mental leap that came with STC and ring dips. Archer pushups are difficult, compound, and they use a complete yet controlled ROM. They hit my triceps hard while also hitting some back and shoulders due to the side-to-side motion, which does not exist for other pushups. The additional activation is because I can push or pull myself from one side to the other, though I am still figuring out how to control whether the transition is more of a push or pull.

Focusing on that lateral motion makes it difficult for me to hold the proper plank form, causing a sag in the hips. I fixed this by piking slightly. I also learned to focus on pushing up and then over since a single push back to the center starting position caused more shoulder grind.

One tricky ""cost"" vs other pushups is a need to rotate the palms. The shifting weight already adds a more uncomfortable load to the heel of the hand that cannot be mitigated by using knuckles or finger tips. Padding can help with this but it should not add friction that impedes the palm rotation. I'll be experimenting with some minor gear like gloves or paralletes.

I'm also finding that a straight arm is more important than widening hand placement. Widening caused more failures without actually increasing intensity. Of course, there is a required minimum width somewhere outside the shoulders.

While I highly recommend archer pushups over any other pushup variant, I'm still searching for how to complete that upper chest. Thankfully, there is another unilateral pushup variant called typewriter pushups. These feel harder than archers due to the persisted isometric load on the upper body. There is no rest between reps because there is no locking out.

Typewriters seem even less documented than archers, so it's unclear how far above the floor I should keep my chest. It needs to be somewhere between nipple scrape and lockout. I'm still new to typewriters but so far it seems that the ideal height is exactly midway. Any lower and my shoulders start to grind. The lateral motion seems to be a shallow rainbow. 

After only a handful of typewriters in each set I can feel the upper chest activation that I've been searching for. Time will tell if I see the visual balance. For now, the feeling alone is exciting enough. I don't have any pics to share and hoping to see some moobs is a bit strange. Anyways, thank you for reading. I'd love to see more tips for bodyweight chest.

The shifting weight already adds a more uncomfortable load to the heel of the hand that cannot be mitigated by using knuckles or finger tips. Padding can help with this but it should not add friction that impedes the palm rotation. I'll be experimenting with some minor gear like gloves or paralletes.

I'm also finding that a straight arm is more important than widening hand placement. Widening caused more failures without actually increasing intensity. Of course, there is a required minimum width somewhere outside the shoulders.

While I highly recommend archer pushups over any other pushup variant, I'm still searching for how to complete that upper chest. Thankfully, there is another unilateral pushup variant called typewriter pushups. These feel harder than archers due to the persisted isometric load on the upper body. There is no rest between reps because there is no locking out.

Typewriters seem even less documented than archers, so it's unclear how far above the floor I should keep my chest. It needs to be somewhere between nipple scrape and lockout. I'm still new to typewriters but so far it seems that the ideal height is exactly midway. Any lower and my shoulders start to grind. The lateral motion seems to be a shallow rainbow. 

After only a handful of typewriters in each set I can feel the upper chest activation that I've been searching for. Time will tell if I see the visual balance. For now, the feeling alone is exciting enough. I don't have any pics to share and hoping to see some moobs is a bit strange. Anyways, thank you for reading. I'd love to see more tips for bodyweight chest.

TLDR: ring deeps and unilateral pushups."
My handstand struggle,"Hi guys, so as the title says, I have been struggling with my handstand progress.

 I started a few months back and at first the progress was coming really fast. 

The thing is, I always only did chest to wall handstands, as I'm terrified of the kickup, which I'm aware is an issue. 

I'm probably an intermediate and strength Is definitely not an issue, however the balance is. At the beginning of my handstand training, I basically measured how far my hands are from the wall everytime and progressed that way.

 After a while I got to a point where my hands are at about one hand away from the wall. Since then I tried to improve my balance and get my feet away from the floor, and I did - a couple times for just seconds. 

Sometimes I found the balance but immediately fell back because of fear of falling forward. Lately I also feel like I'm using way too much strength in the handstand and have zero balance and awareness. I can't seem to get my alignment right either. 

I feel a lot of preassure on my shoulders and I'm not sure if that's normal.
 I always do my handstands on the wall for 45 seconds for 4sets, resting 2 minutes between.
 I do them after my warm up and before my push workouts, which I do twice per week. 

Should I start practicing handstands more often? I never did because after push sessions I would always be sore and I feel like it would limit my handstands a lot. 
Also it seems like handstands are interrupting my hypertrophy workouts, which I mainly focus on.
 Today I felt very weak after handstands and incline pike push ups were almost impossible with proper form. 

What is the fastest way to progress and get away from the wall? How many times per week should I train the handstand, since I'm focusing on hypertrophy training? I will appreciate any tips.",0,"My handstand struggleHi guys, so as the title says, I have been struggling with my handstand progress.

Is my routine adequate? Yoga/Music teacher's adventures into BWF p.2,"Hello!  
\[she/her/hers\]  


So, since my last post I've had a lot of progress with my routine. I even got some equipment because apparently I love strength training and even a little bit of weights. Feels very grounding + I can listen to lectures during working out. Plus, this girl can now scare catcallers away by just flexing, haha.

I switched my routine twice (well, mostly rearranged what I do) and figured that yes, now that I have the equipment, I can do 3 days of RR a week + some changes due to my lifestyle.

I wanted to hear some opinions on how my routine looks, if someone has the time and energy for it, please.

Basically, it's 3 RR pairs, after which I change the core work and add some skill and counter-work afterwards. The set to reps ration is the usual. I focus more on the breath, form and countering, control vs speed, no bursts. Additionally, I do points 1-7 w/ ankle and wrist weights (1 kg each) to remind myself about better form, control, and alignment instead of dropping everything.  


1. First Pair of RR
2. Second Pair of RR
3. Third Pair of RR
4. Core work (w/ stabilisation focus):  
Paripurna Navasana 30-60 sec  
Ardha Navasana 30-60 sec  
(these are static core holds in different shapes; can easily look them up)  
Hanging leg raises
5. Arm raises w/ dumbbell:   
Frontal raises  
Lateral raises  
(different rotation of the arm based on the week; one arm at a time w/ stabilisation; currently 6 kg)
6. Side forearm plank:   
Arm raises (from waist to ceiling and overhead on exhale to lenghten, back on inhale)  
Leg raises (upper arm lengthened to the ceiling)
7. Extension work (Shalabhasana; I think you call them backbend arches or similar?):   
Arm and head raises on inhale  
Leg raises on exhale  
Diagonal arm/leg extention and raise on inhale w/ head changing which side it faces.
8. Inversions (once each):   
Handstand 1-3 min  
Headstand (supported and countered) 3 min w/ 2 variations, each 1 min  
Bound supported shoulderstand for countering, 3 min
9. Other countering as needed and rest.

This takes me about two hours (a little more depending on the day) to complete, and I feel just wonderful and energized for the whole day. Points 5-9 really make it a relaxing time for me after a workout, and I've never felt as good in my yoga practice. Everything feels more complete and connected now.

Ring dips - lacking shoulder mobility?,"I've been working my way up to trying ring dips (don't have anywhere to do bar dips).  I'm up to 35seconds X 3 RTO support hold so thought I'd give them a go today. 

The only way I can get anywhere close to getting my elbow angle to 90 degrees is by leaning forward a lot.  I can feel my shoulders 'shrugging' upwards as I do this, presumably meaning I'm not keeping my scapulae fixed in position.  I realise this is bad form and I will continue to work on support holds for strength, but is a lack of shoulder extension whats holding me back here?

I youtubed some shoulder exercises and they all talk about importance of keeping the scapula retracted and depressed but this is very difficult.

rto push up vs deep ring push ups,"Hey all!
I have gotten comfortable with doing 20+ reps of ring push ups (with rings turned out on the top) and i want to move on to a more challenging movement. I am debating whether i should move on to rto push ups or deep ring push ups. My current goal is chest hypertrophy and strength. I also want to put more emphasis on the upper portion of my chest because my lower chest is overdeveloped because of dips.

I heard that the RTO push up stimulates the upper chest more because it has a similar movement pattern to a reverse grip bench press, which is supposedly a good upper chest exercise. On the other hand, I heard that the deep ring push ups are good for upper chest because of increased ROM.

Also, one last question, if i were to perform RTO push ups should i do them with slightly flared elbows if i want to stimulate my chest more?",0,"rto push up vs deep ring push upsHey all!

can someone explain to me the type of stress this puts on your hands/grip? when guys do horizantal torso on chin bars w/o feet to stop rotation,"https://i.imgur.com/3VlIPRa.png

I can only get my brain around ""shoulder below hands"" type of hanging. That's the type of thing I'm used to doing with chins and pullups.

I guess I'm not understanding ""why don't the hands spin around the bar"" when arms are at the angle this guy's are in the pics. Maybe I'm being low-IQ about physics or something?

As best I can think of this, by leaning backwards your center-of-mass is no longer ""below"" your shoulders so where they go wouldn't matter, and it does look like his navel is underneath the bar.

So in theory maybe you don't need to grip the bar at all (ie just bend the first knuckle but not the rest?) to create anti-rotation? Like one of those ""no hands pull"" wrist monstrosities but not quite so extreme?

But the stress is clearly different on the lats in some way because of the angle of the torso and I guess the leverage on the lats?",0,"can someone explain to me the type of stress this puts on your hands/grip? when guys do horizantal torso on chin bars w/o feet to stop rotation

"Are sandbag lifts enough to replace squats &amp; deadlifts to strength the whole posterior chain and legs? If not, then what do you suggest?","I plan to only use calisthenics for upper body, as my goal is to attain the basic advanced exercises (Handstand Push Up, Planche Push Up, Front Lever Row, One Arm Pull Up and Muscles Ups). The reason for these moves are that they’ll stick with me and maintain strength to perform in any sports and life activities without reliance on external weight, and keeping equipment minimal since at most the luxury of rings is a nice addition.

As stated above, one of my goal is to keep my equipment minimal at home in my studio apartment. I have a pull up bar, rings, parallettes, and a 50 lb strongman sandbag on the way. I also have a pair of Olympic Dumbbell Handles, but don’t wanna try on them if I can just get the same strength gain benefits from Sandbags and Bodyweight.

I’d like to add that I’ll be joining MMA, bjj, judo and other martial arts facilities. If I ever need further strength at a faster pace, then I’ll use their weights (assuming they have).

As for the sandbag move to strengthen the muscles that deadlift and squats hit would be sandbag shouldering.

This would mean my routine would be the Recommended Routine for upper body, and progressively moving up in weight with sandbag shouldering as my replacement for both the squat and deadlift.

Again, the goal is to keep the daily routine minimal, fast, yet productive in preventing and reducing injury, while developing the strength needed to handle 200 plus pound (and heavier to 300 lb) opponents, as well as handle daily tasks like kindly helping buddies move easily.

I assume that if I can eventually shoulder a 250 to 300 lbs sandbag, for reps and sets, that I’ll have all the posterior chain and squat muscle strength needed to be equally or even stronger than those that use exclusively barbell, dumbbells or kettlebells as their primary strength methods.

So, what is your experience, knowledge and opinions on this approach of mine?

I have been doing weighted hanging dips and he has been doing weighted cross-bench dips, but I'm beginning to wonder the science behind which would be easier to overload and by what degree.

For example, is me adding +70 pounds to my hanging weighted dip the equivalent of him having a plate on his lap + 35 pound weighted vest on a cross-bench dip? I can't find much information on this as it really doesn't matter much otherwise for lifting purposes.",0,"Cross-Bench Dips vs Hanging DipsMy friend and I have been having a friendly competition on who is progressing faster and can do more weight (with good form and mid-range reps) on weighted dips.

"I'm getting no-where with pullups, but I really want to!","Heya,

I'm a 17 year old girl, and I do circus stuff. I'm aiming to be able to do 10 consecutive pullups within the next 10 months.

I have a pullup bar in a doorframe in my house, but just training pullups doesn't seem to help me at all, even if I do them every day they don't seem to get any easier, and I'm stuck at around 3 or 4 consecutive.

Any advice on exercises that could help me build strength for more pullups would be much appreciated!

Also I have a much easier time doing the first half of the pullup than the last half. Getting my arms to a right-angle is easy, but then past that and especially pulling my chest to the bar is incredibly difficult.",0,"I'm getting no-where with pullups, but I really want to!Heya,

"question about ""reverse push up"" equipment","I know you can do those in a smith rack but I don't have the space/money for it.

I remember you could buy these oversized 3-4ft tall pushup handles for doing dips which you could also use for doing reverse pushups (aka australian pullup or bodyweight row)

But is there any common name to refer to this equipment? I'm finding it a real pain to do searches on places I can order them online.

Vagely remember some guide on how you can make your own buying PVC pipe from a hardware store like Home Depot but can't find it again...

Also I'm over 250 so PVC would make me a bit nervous, I think I'd prefer metal even if that means it's heavier to cart around, just so I know it won't snap.

Looking for Advice on a Flexible Routine,"I have a one month baby, but I am looking to get back into some sort of routine again.

How to incorporate callisthenic exercises into my training routine? Really need some help here,"Hello. I’m 19 male, 82kg at around 16-19% bodyfat. My english can sometimes suck because I’m not a native speaker, so sorry about that. I recently made a post here about why am I losing my pull up gains so fast whenever I’m not practicing them. There’s what that post was for short: If for some reason if I don’t do any pull ups in the span of 2-3 days I lose around 4 reps from my PR and it takes me a week of daily pull ups do regain my strength back. 


In order to maintain my PR I need to do at least 2 sets per day (usually till failure) and if I want to improve I do several sets a day. If I really go at it I would do 15 sets of different pull up variations in a single workout (3x10 chin ups; 3x10 normal pull ups; 3x10 wide pull ups; 3x10 neutral grip pull ups and 3x10 close grip pull ups). However, I got told in the comments I’m overtraining and doing myself more harm than good with this kind of training. 


I got told I should switch to weighted pull ups only with a weight with I can limit myself to 3 sets of 10 reps. I workout around 4-5 times per week at the gym and I usually do some cardio after each of my workouts. What I want tho, is to take it a step further with callisthenics and get into harder elements. Honestly I’ve been neglecting everything, but the pull ups. I just love doing pull ups, but again, I want to achieve things like the planche, front lever, human flag, one arm pull ups, etc one day. 


Here’s where I’m at now in terms of my callisthenics PR’s: 23 chin ups, 20 pull ups, 34kg x 3 weighted chin ups, 3 minutes and 20 seconds dead hang, 11 dips, 45 push ups, 4 minutes plank, 6 pistol squats, 2 decent form muscle ups (both hands over the bar at the same time), 11 bad form muscle ups (with my left hand over the bar first) and I can get myself in the front lever position, but I can’t hold it for more than a second or so. I can also do a lot of different variations of those exercises but I’m not gonna list everything. 


I have a pull up bar at home and somebody recommended me to get some rings, are they worth it? What other products like this I should get? How should I incorporate my bodyweight exercises into my workout routine? So far I’ve been just doing pull ups every day, push ups and plank whenever I remembered and I’ll sometimes randomly search for callisthenic workouts on YouTube and doing them. 


Should I add some bodyweight exercises into my gym workouts? Or should I just have bodyweight workouts all together? I’ve been adding arm wrestling exercises into my arms workouts too. So I’m now already doing 3 different kinds of workouts and I’m starting to get very lost on how to organise them.

Need advice on exercise routine,"Hello experts of BWF! I seek advice with my routine. I am a 25 yr old male, and I exercise around 2-3 times a week. I follow a routine very similar to the one recommended on this subreddit.

I recently obtained gymnatic rings. I am a complete beginner with this. A quick search from the net showed exercises to start with. I am able to do the basic movements, though I still have much to improve with my form. 

My question is should I replace my routine exclusively with ring workouts? I feel like rings give more of a challenge and is better overall. If so, any advice on what should be my new routine.

"My journey, ,more than a couple of startmoments....but I have a tip!","Hi all, espec.those who procrastinate or have difficulty with choosing a routine or sticking to it. My take :
I started more than a couple of times...Ive got a lot of books.....

My AHA moment was yesterday....I ve got a chronic depression and Borderline Pers.disorder and choosing or sticking to something is what I found hard with BW.

But

After starting 2y ago but 3 times stopping/ not going to the gym ( anxiety and/ or Covid) I did this and maybe it will help someone else?

I did not know if I would loose weight And gain muscle / how to choose a routine,so I began with this: 1300kcal/ a day and once a week not. And Every day I go down on the floor and do pushups. Perfect form,5 times and first only 1 or 2, now 7 eacht time.
Mostly 2 in the morning, 3 after noon.

I just know I need to do this 5times. Thats it.


After 3 months my hips stick out. I see some abs. My arms are muscular  and my back and chest too. I lost for my feeling 2kgs, but weigh 1 kg less so maybe even gained muscles?I just see result and now I incorporate my pullups/ dead hangs/ active hangs. 5 times a day. Nothing on sundays. 
Each day I try to walk 1 or 2 hours  / 10.000 -15000 steps.
Thats it.

Now I see I did this and it has results, I am going to up it more.
Maybe even 3 times a week a circuit. Or not.

But these small steps, just 5 times laying on the floor and pushing up, changed me.

Husband (36M) not attracted to me (32F),"My ego has taken a severe hit and I’m trying to recuperate the damages.

My husband told me he’s no longer attracted to me sexually or physically. He’s objectively handsome, athletic build (top heavy skipped a lot of leg days) and hasn’t changed much since we’ve been married. When he does lose a little muscle mass he doesn’t like it, lifts weights for like a week and is back to his normal self. I have the same body type now that I had when we got married 5 years ago but in 2019 I did drop 6 pants sizes with diet and exercise and gain it back in 2020. Everyone else saw the changes but I couldn’t, so I didn’t feel the need to keep killing myself in the gym for no progress. Body dysmorphia is real. He says it started then. Not only did he say he’s no longer attracted to me, he told me sometimes he has to fantasize someone else to be intimate with me. I felt like he could’ve left that part out because that was really the hit when I was already down.

It took a lot of work over the last 5 years to 1) get out from under my self deprecating insecurities and love me for me, body neutral and confident, 2) become a submissive wife learning to respect my husbands authority and opinion… so while I’m glad he expressed his feelings and I fully intend to get back in the gym this week and develop a routine that is sustainable long term I’m really struggling with wanting my husband to touch me, see me naked, or have sex and I know that’s only going to make things worse… I’m really trying to process this information without the emotions but I’m struggling. Have any of you ever dealt with this or have advice for how to get past it? I’d really appreciate the male perspective.

I’ve just started training Brazilian Jiu Jitzu, and I’m really enjoying it. I feel like I get a really good work out every time I go do a session. But I struggle a lot with it in some aspects like being taken down and holding certain positions because I’m just not heavy enough. I know it’s partly technique, but my coach said it’s a good idea to get heavier, considering I’m quite light for my height. I used to be a pro level cyclist, so really quite light, especially my upper body. I’m 25, male, 200cm tall and I usually hover around 82-83kgs. I would  like to get myself into the high 90’s (even 100kgs if possible) if my body frame allows it. I feel like resistance training with my body weight would be the most efficient way to build lean muscle mass, and just wondering how I should start? Im thinking just standard sorta things for now, sit ups, push ups, squats, etc to work on form before I start adding extra weight. But is there any exercises and/or tips anyone has that they swear by or something a noob like me should know? 

Also, nutrition seems like a big complicated world. At least more complicated than what I’m used to. Cycling nutrition pretty much involved carbs, carbs and a few more carbs, with some caffeine here and there. No fats, not a heck of a lot of protein compared to what most people think (it’s no secret there’s different substances used in recovery for cycling). Any nutrition advice helps a lot. I also have an incredibly fast metabolism. I’m used to eating 4000+ calories a day, especially the day after race day or during stage races.",0,"Weight Gaining TipsHey guys/gals,

Rehabbing golfers elbow - What resistance bands?,"Can anyone tell me what resistance band i should start with to get back into pull ups? 

I've never used them and can't find this specific info anywhere as every site and video is just variation on ""ok bras, you want to get your fist pull up, well grab a band liek this medium one here and sling it over a bar and you'll get your pull up in no time.. now sign up to my mailing list and order your bands here.."".

Back ground: Three or so years of calisthenics, gave myself tendonitis pretty fast, managed it with grip variations (no more chin ups, then moving to a neutral grip when pull ups became to painful) but am finally at a place where even a neutral grip focused on the smaller fingers isn't stopping flair ups anymore. 

I'm about three weeks into a de-load month now. Elbow Pain is getting a bit better but I would like to get back to lifting before i start to atrophy and i know if just go back to doing what i was doing they'll just flair up again. 

So what band rating do i need? Is the rating how much weight they will assist with? Like if i'm 100kg should i get a band with a rating of 50kg?

30 (35) Days Body Progression at age 16.,"**Before starting:**

Height: 175 cm (5.7 feet)

Weight: 83 kg (183 pounds)

Age: 16

Deadlift PR: 80kg/176lbs (at age 14)

Benchpress PR: 50kg/110lbs (at age 14)

**Story behind why i decided to do the challenge.**

So i attend a boarding school where i met a person who would become one of my very good friends. Our school has a power lifting room and a fitness room and a chef who makes mostly healthy food. I told my friend about the idea after working out for the first time in 2 years. The idea was basically no sugar drinks, no candy or chips and no junk food and then train as often as possible. We both wanted to lose some kg's and kill time since it can get boring having hours of free time in a school. I haven't told him but for me it was mainly because of a girl i liked A LOT, and after coming to her room one night we talked and she said that she wanted to be no more than friends with benefits, normally i wouldn't care to much and just move on and find another one, but this girl literally made me smile just thinking about her. My friend was up for the idea and we started. Day by day i powertrained first and then ran on a treadmill 7-10 km (4-6 miles) everyday. The first 14 days i had run 55 kilometers (34 miles) and power lifted everyday and eaten 1800-2000 calories while burning 400-600 everyday from training. I didn't have a weight scale on the school so i had no idea how much weight i had lost before coming home, sadly i had to stop running the 14th day as i realised i had gotten myself a leg injury by running to much, but my mood was really good when i got home and stepped foot on the weight scale i had already lost between 5-6 kg (11-13 pounds) and that highly motivated me to keep going. I started eating small amounts of candy and chips once in a while after 14 days if my calories was under 1800 and i had gotten all my meals for the day. With friends saying they can see changes around your face and me being more positive, that motivated me even more to just keep going. I still train as often as i can, and i've just bought a subscription to a gym center since im home on holidays right now, only bad thing is i have skipped 3 days of training the past 1.5 weeks because of partying and me being hungover the day after.

Does increased muscle mass increase resting heart rates?,"My RHR has increased from 61bpm to 65 bpm since 10 days ago (Dec 16). It even went to 66 one day. This is very abnormal for me as my RHRs were very stable for a year (average was 59-60 bpm).

One thing I can think of is overtraining. I started weight lifting on Nov 20 and increased intensity gradually. I do it 30 mins a day everyday. I don’t have a rest day. And I did constantly feel muscle sore. I did some research and found overtraining could be a reason. So I stopped my training for 3 days but my RHR is still 65 bpm today.

I also learned increased muscle mass might be a reason but there wasn't too much scientific study about it. My weight increased 3kg in the past month, which is very significant.

Has anyone experienced this? Or could it be Fitbit’s software update? Would like to share your thoughts.

Shoulder Impingement and body weight exercises,"Hello all,

I’ve recently been dealing with pain in my shoulder that after some conversations with my doctor have led to my conclusion that I am dealing with shoulder impingement. I have been attempting to alleviate some of the pain with body weight exercises in place of my usual lifting, and am yet to see any serious results. 

One exercise I have repeatedly seen mentioned is hangs off of a pull-up bar to stretch the shoulder. When I do this, it feel pretty good until I go to push my head “through” my arms and retract my scapula a bit more. This movement causes more pain, and more interestingly, usually makes my shoulder “pop” as I can literally feel one of the muscles slide forward quickly as if it was previously caught on something.  Wanted to post this here to see if anyone else had had an experience similar to this, and if so, what you did to improve your symptoms. Thanks!",0,"Shoulder Impingement and body weight exercisesHello all,

Question about lower body exercise from recommended routine,"Normally I did weight training 3-4 days a week. But the lockdown started again in my country, and the fitness closed, so I tried bodyweight training. I followed the recommended routine from this sub. For the upper body, I think the volume is enough to maintain and develop muscle. But for the lower body, I feel like the volume is not enough to maintain my muscle. I do beginner shrimp squat and single leg hamstring slide.  I feel the current progression is too easy, but my mobility and coordination is not good enough to do the next progression. Should I increase the rep or set from 3X5-8 or keep doing this until I am good enough for the next progression?",0,"Question about lower body exercise from recommended routineNormally I did weight training 3-4 days a week.

beginner guide to calisthenics,"hey guys! recently i've made a video about how to start doing calisthenics, where I'm showing the most basic calisthenics exercises and easier variations of them for beginners.

What workout structure gave you the best strength gains?,"I plateaued on the weighted pull up for a while. I was running a sets of

Warm up:

1 set of either 4 muscle ups or high pull ups

Main Set:

5 reps of 85 pounds

5 reps of 80 pounds

6 reps of 70.

I tried to get to 90(2 plates) but I was stuck at 4 reps. Unfortunately I got into a car accident and it took me out for a while. When I got back I had to humble myself and start back at 70 pounds for 5 reps. For the longest time I was stuck at 80 pounds for 5, and could occasionally hit the 85 for 5 but not like I had before. I tried experimenting switching grips up, etc but I didn't see much improvement. 

One day I decided to change my routine up a bit.  I noticed I was lacking was volume. I changed my routine to:

5 reps of 80

5 reps of 80

9-12 reps of a plate.

2 weeks later I could hit 95 for 5. Curious to hear if anyone else has stories about breaking plateaus by changing up a workout. One thing I realized was how specific of a change I needed to make to break the plateau. I had tried to change it up by adding one set of 15-20 bodyweight chins after my set as I do not work chins and thought maybe my biceps were my weak point. But it didn't really do anything for me.",0,"What workout structure gave you the best strength gains?I plateaued on the weighted pull up for a while. I was running a sets of

I usually consume 3.8-4.4 per kg of protein. Is this Okay?," 

I'm 16 M and I am an active person doing workouts 5-6 a week in a gym. I am 5'2 and weigh 128 which is a healthy weight. I'm here to ask about the protein intake I'm taking daily because recently I read an article (Forgot the title) that too much protein could harm my kidney. 4 per kilogram is about 228 grams of protein daily but I sometimes could go a little higher around 250. I am clean bulking; not eating crappy foods such as fast foods but I do eat lean meats and mostly dairy for my diet. My protein came from dairy mostly; 1 cup of cottage cheese at night, 2 cups of greek yogurt, and about 2/5 of low-fat milk, also some 6 pieces of Tyson's chicken breast strips which I cook in an oven. I don't know for sure if this protein intake can cause any harm to my body in the long term but I have only done this 2 weeks ago and have never seen any significant symptoms of any sickness but instead seen an improvement in my physique and have gotten stronger lifting weights and can perform more sets and reps than consuming less protein before. Is this okay if I gonna keep this journey forward or shall I just decrease my protein intake to reduce the ""might"" consequences in the future? Provide at least evidence of why protein high protein intake can harm kidneys. I will fully appreciate yall answers down below people.

Which do you think is more effective and why, for muscle hypertrophy provided additional weight and progression can be applied to both?

Inverted Ring Rows vs Barbell Rows

Ring Pull Ups vs Bar Pull ups

Chest Dips vs Bench Press vs Weighted Deficit Push Ups

Working out gave me man boobs,"For context, I started something similar to the RR almost 2 months ago.

I turned 16 8 days ago.

I'm in the really late stages of puberty, in fact I might have ended puberty already, so I dont think that could have caused my man boobs

I have very low fat, like sub 15 percent at least. I know it's not caused by fat in the chest area but rather breast tissue

I've heard working out may have given me a huge surge of testosterone which may have caused temporary Gynecomastia, but I haven't felt any increase in libido or my voice, so I don't think my testosterone increased rapidly, if at all. 

I did start quite a bit of milk for my protein needs (600 to 700 daily according to rough estimates). Peanut butter and rolled oats too. I just found out these foods are high in Estrogen. Could that be it? There seems to be conflicting information on whether or not plant based Estrogen affects the human body, or whether Estrogen traces in milk is enough to have any sort of effect",0,"Working out gave me man boobsFor context, I started something similar to the RR almost 2 months ago.

mealtime guidelines from an old book," Leviticus 11:3 reads, “Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof, having cloven hooves and chewing the cud—that you may eat.”

The Bible goes on to say that the camel and rabbit are not acceptable to eat because they chew their cud, but don’t have split hooves. On the flip-side, pigs are also not acceptable to eat “having cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud, is unclean to you” (Leviticus 11:7). All other land animals are forbidden by the Bible which include mice, reptiles, amphibians and mollusks.

**List of clean land animals\***  
(\* Please note: these lists are not exhaustive.)

* Antelope
* The cow family
* Caribou
* Deer

Concerning fish, we are told in Leviticus 11:9, 12, “These you may eat of all that are in the water: whatever in the water has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers—that you may eat...Whatever in the water does not have fins or scales—that shall be an abomination to you.”

Tuna, salmon and trout are “clean,” as well as any other fish that have both fins and scales. Only sea creatures that have scales and fins are suitable for food, therefore this would eliminate oysters, shellfish, crabs, lobsters, shrimp, and many other types of seafood as foods safe to eat.

### Insects

📷

God even includes insects in His list of clean and unclean animals. Leviticus 11:22-23 states that, “These you may eat: the locust after its kind, the destroying locust after its kind, the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind. But all other flying insects which have four feet shall be an abomination to you.”

## For Jews only?

Some people have thought that when God prohibited certain “unclean” meat it applied only to the Jews. But in Noah’s time, God made a clear distinction as to which animals were “clean” and which were “unclean.” This was centuries before any Jews existed. Therefore, God’s health principles were not limited to any race or nation but were given for the benefit of the entire human race",1,"mealtime guidelines from an old book Leviticus 11:3 reads, “Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof, having cloven hooves and chewing the cud—that you may eat.”

When to start working out when underweight?,"I'm a male, 190cm or 6ft 4 inches tall and I weigh 64 kg. This means I’m very tall and very skinny.

Or should I start working out as soon as I start eating the proper food. I was thinking that going to the gym would cause me to lose weight as would've only just started getting more calories.

Meal-prep salad opinion - how many days would this low-calorie bean and veg salad last?,"If I made enough of this chickpea salad for a week (i.e. one portion day), would they last for the full week in the fridge without going off?

**Ingredients:**

**Veg (all raw unless specified):**
- mushrooms
- broccoli
- carrots
- red onion
- bell peppers
- green beans (microwaved)
- peas (microwaved)
- tomatoes
- cucumber

**Legumes:**
- canned cooked chickpeas
- canned cooked black beans

**Dressing / sauce:**
- lemon juice
- olive oil
- salt
- black pepper
- basil leaves

**Instructions:**
- dice all veg (after cooking those necessary) into bitesize chunks
- add them to a big mixing bowl
- strain and add the canned legumes to that same bowl
- add eye-balled / to taste amounts of the dressing ingredients
- mix together, and dole out into 7 separate containers
- put into fridge to chill until ready to eat (cold)

Is this a possibility? By day 2-3 the veg would be a little softer, and some of it would have oxidised (I guess?) and thus turned a bit brown (specifically the mushrooms), taking on a stronger / B.O.ish smell (any idea why that is?

Oatmeal Questions.,"I’m recovering from Covid, no taste or smell.  Also I had a gastric bypass five years ago.  I’m maintaining weight loss, need some advice. I eat oatmeal every single day. I have in my arsenal long cook oats, quick oats, organic oats, rolled oats, and steel cut oats. Trader Joe’s, Quaker, ALDI, McCann, Bobs Red Mill.  I don’t want added sugar or any other added stuff, just the oatmeal. One type from Trader Joe’s is ancient grains, which wasn’t too bad. I cook my oatmeal on a gas stove.   


I need the best quality for my health. I don’t know which type of oats are the best, health wise. I need to maintain weight, hard to eat with no taste. It’s been over a month without taste and smell. My energy level is not good, and I work night shift. I take specialty vitamins as I have malabsorption syndrome. My RD said all oats are basically the same and I need to watch my carb intake. I burn carbs at work like crazy, so I need energy and about 100g of protein a day.

Whenever there is a gathering and there is a cheese board - I never know what to do or how to eat it/pair it. But i do know I like brie with jam, and there was a funky blue cheese that I was shocked to discover I like. Onward to more discovery!

I’m a real month how much money does it take you to feed your family?,"I feel like I see people say that they spend 200 a month to feed two people. I just don’t believe it. They must not be mentioning that they already have lots of meat in the freezer or that their pantry is already stocked or that they actually eat out 3-4 nights a week. 

We definitely can trim our budget but it’s not uncommon for us to spend nearly $250 a week at Walmart (granted we have a family of 5 and 2 of them are in diapers). 

I just can’t fathom how people are claiming that they can feed a couple of people for so little.",1,"I’m a real month how much money does it take you to feed your family?I feel like I see people say that they spend 200 a month to feed two people.

Chickpea and Butter Bean mash,"I eat this pretty much everyday and since recommended the recipe a lot to my flatmates who’ve enjoyed it too! Very earthy but light. 

Ingredients - can of chickpeas, can of butter beans, creme freshe, bacon (or choice of substitute), (all sorts of alternates listed below. 

1.) Fry the bacon (sometimes I do this but with an egg as well, or without bacon completely)

2.) Then add some butter to the pan to deglaze it abit. 

3.) Add chickpeas and butter beans in a little bit of butter with pepper and salt.

4.) Cook till their golden and light brown. The shells will start to slip off the butter beans that’s a good sign.

5.) Take them off the heat and into a bowl (it’s best to use a food processor apparently but i don’t have one) then mash with a fork and fold in the creme freshe! 

(interesting if you fry some chorizo instead of the bacon and you can cook the beans in the chorizo fat. But chorizo is abit expensive) 

my flatmate cracks and egg into the actual mix ! but i can’t say it looked very appealing. (egg theme week!) 

occasionally this is quite a nice side dish with a meatier meal like a steak or gammon or something.",1,"Chickpea and Butter Bean mashI eat this pretty much everyday and since recommended the recipe a lot to my flatmates who’ve enjoyed it too! Very earthy but light.

Indian/Central Asian dish for Christmas,"

Shrimp (or not) casserole,"Here is my favorite recipe for a lazy weeknight, which you can either add shrimp to if you’re feeling bougie or keep vegetarian!

Ingredients:
1 cup basmati rice 
1 tablespoon olive (or whichever!) oil
1 onion (any kind but red)
4 cloves of garlic
1 can (796mL) of crushed or peeled tomatoes
1 cup of room temperature cream OR 1 can (165mL) of coconut milk
1 tablespoon sugar
1 or more tablespoon oregano (to taste) 
3 (or whatever) tablespoons fresh dill
Squeeze of lemon juice to serve 

OPTIONAL IF ON SALE: shrimps! 

Start by cooking the rice according to package instructions. Thaw your shrimps if using. I later remove the tails.
Chop the onion and finely chop the garlic.
Heat up olive oil in a large pan on medium heat, then brown the onion and the garlic.. Add the oregano and salt/pepper to taste and cook some more until fragrant. 
Open and add your can of tomatoes, then add the sugar. Let it come to a gentle boil and let it simmer until it reduced a little (about 5 minutes).
Slowly add your cream (so it doesn’t split) or coconut milk while stirring. Taste and adjust seasoning.
If using, remove from heat and add your shrimps, covering them in the sauce and let them cook for about 5 minutes until ready.
Serve on the rice with fresh dill and a squeeze of lemon juice. 

Tasty? Easy? Lots of leftovers? Yes!! 
The possibilities with this recipe are amazing. Sometimes I add feta cheese for protein instead of shrimps, sometimes I serve it on naan bread instead of rice. It can be vegan or vegetarian and guests love it.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Fruit Leather Guide,"Fruit Leather is a great way to make fruit last longer and to get your non-fruit-loving people to eat it. It's best made with a dehydrator, but you can also make it in your oven (I've also read about leaving it covered in the sun for several hours, but I'll let you decide if that's going to give you food poisoning or not).

You can use most fruits for this. The result will be a leather or crunchy chip, depending on how long you dry it for. I've tried a number of different fruits and the only one I will warn against is watermelon - tried it as a lark and it's just crunchy sugar. I really like strawberries and blueberries mixed together.

Our dehydrator is a round Cosori model and cost about $70. It's about 3 years old now and we've made beef jerky, fruit Leather, and plenty of other dehydrated foods with it. It has paid for itself already. You will need solid tray inserts for it (ours came with 2, I found 3 more online).

The last batch I made used 1 package of fresh strawberries (use frozen if they're cheaper) and 2 packs of blueberries. Rinse everything, toss any nasty ones, remove the leaves from the strawberries, dump them into a food processor or blender (processor works better) and puree them. Pour them onto the trays as thick as you can, spreading them evenly. If you go too thin, they stick to the tray and are hard to remove.

Check the recipe book for your dehydrator for time and temp. Ours was 8 hours at 165°F (70-75°C). If not fully dry, peel off, flip over on the tray, and give another hour or two.",1,"Fruit Leather GuideFruit Leather is a great way to make fruit last longer and to get your non-fruit-loving people to eat it.

Better quiche recipe,"Some time ago, I posted this [Quiche recipe]https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/mub01b/spinach_bacon_quiche/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) which is still my favorite. 

But thanks to Bigger Bolder Baking, I've discovered a better crust. I've also been making half the original recipe because now that I can make it quicker and easier, I make fresh rather than freezing portions. 

This method takes about an hour, and most of that is cooking time. 

Quick Crust

Pour 1 cup of flour into a 6-inch baking pan. (I use a small Corning dish.)       
Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt over the flour. Mix with a fork.     
Add 3 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons water. Mix to make a stiff dough. Add up to 1 tablespoon water if needed.       
Using fingers and knuckles, spread to cover the bottom of the pan, and about 1 inch up the sides. Make the crust as thin as possible. 

This makes a very thin and crispy crust. It doesn't get soggy like a regular crust can. 

Make half the quiche recipe. Pour into the crust. (No pre-baking needed.) Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes.",1,"Better quiche recipeSome time ago, I posted this [Quiche recipe] which is still my favorite.

"My favorite healthy, filling and cheap breakfast","Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my daily breakfast oatmeal recipe that I find delicious, healthy and filling. Half the ingridients are non perishable, you'll just have to get new dairy ingridients every week

Non-perishable:

Chia seeds ( superfood that thickens the oatmeal)
Old fashioned oats (substance of the oatmeal)

Buy weekly:

Fat free milk (almond / cashew / oat milk work just fine)
Fat free Plain Greek Yogurt (this is to make it creamy)

In a container, mix in 1/4 cup of oats, with 1 tsp of chia seeds, 1 Tblsp Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup of milk. Mix all together and leave in fridge overnight and up to 5 days. To serve, add 1/3 cup of hot or cold milk and mix again for a delicious serving of creamy oatmeal.

I usually make 5 portions on Sunday night to last me all week. I use this recipe as a canvas to explore flavors and toppings. On weight lifting days, I mix in a scoop of protein power. Sometimes I add vanilla or almond extract and honey. During the summer I add frozen berries and honey. On cold days I add cinnamon and brown sugar. You can add nuts, bananas, peanut butter, fruit preserves, chocolate chips, dry fruit, fresh fruits and anything that sounds good to you. 

The cost per portion is $2.00, which includes one large container of oats($5), one lb bag of chia seeds ($10), 1 gallon of milk ( $12) and 3 large containers of yogurt ($15) for a whole month (approx 20-22 servings) plus any toppings you desire.

"5-ish ingredient white bean curry! So cheap, so easy!","PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/y8gCn9X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y8gCn9X.jpg)

I'm working on a project where I have to develop 5-ingredient vegan recipes and WHEW, it's been challenging. But also rewarding to find ways to make super tasty meals without many ingredients.

The first one I did was a beet 'ricotta' dumpling with dilly plant-based yogurt which we loved, but I made these white beans last night, and they were amazing! Today I'm doing a fun roasted red pepper mushroom ragu.

A few notes, when I do these... I don't include water, salt, pepper, or oil in my ingredient count (mainly because these ingredients show up in nearly every single recipe and they are kitchen staples for most households, so they don't count toward my ingredient limit thank god, haha). 

Here's how I made it!

Ingredients:

* 1 pound dry small white beans, soaked for 2–3 hours.  (Note, you can also use (2) 15-ounce cans of white beans in this recipe)
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 ribs of celery, with leaves, diced
* 1 tablespoon hot or mild curry powder
* 6 cups water
* 15-ounce can coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Soak the beans:**

* Cover the beans with water and soak for at least 2 hours. Drain off the water and set aside.

**Cook the aromatics:**

* Heat the neutral oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 7–8 minutes until softened. Season with salt and pepper.
* Add the curry powder and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the beans:**

Add the beans to the pot and toss to coat with the curry powder. Season with salt. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours or until the beans are tender (timing will depend on bean variety). If using canned beans, cook only 30 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper. 

**Finish the beans:**

Pour in the coconut milk and simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Taste and season once more.

**To serve:**

Serve with crusty bread or fresh herbs, if you like.",1,"5-ish ingredient white bean curry! So cheap, so easy!PIC: [

Awesome cooking-jam with my mom... whole chickens.,"I wanted chicken soup base, ended up buying two roasting chickens.  I got my mom to be dry-hands... basically an assistant who does anything that requires the poultry-molester to wash them's hands.

Mom's payment for being dry-hands is that she would get the breasts.  I was thinking boneless-skinless, she wanted roast and I gave her ribcage with the herbs she plated for me shoved under the skin.  (Considering the timeline and a shared kitchen, I can take that ribcage back for the broth.)  Also made her dig out a bigger glass-casserole than the three-cups I had set out in expectation of marinating boneless-skinless breasts.  They would have worked, but anyway I made the breasts her problem because they're a horrible soup ingredient.

In my explanation of tomorrow's step, which is stripping the meat off of the cooked back-half and bagging it in drippings for freezing, I mentioned how a month or two ago we got a 10-pound ground beef chub into 1-pound ziplocs because mom was holding the ziplocs while I did the rest.

LPT: it's cheaper and healthier to make your own chocolate syrup.,"It's pretty simple half cup of coco powder and your choice of sugar or sugar alternative 1 cup and 1/2 or 1 cup of water or low-fat milk, this makes about 12-16oz of syrup (or close to a bottle) but depending on what recipe you follow can be more or less. 

Stir and microwave for 30 secs to melt sugar Crystals.

I use stevia I buy with coupons but you can use whatever you like or buy cheaply. 

This tastes much better than premade syrup, healthier (even if you use sugar it's not as processed or you can make it sugar free or less sugar) 

All in all cost of coco powder in bulk 5$ or 3$ regular size and sugar 1-2$ 4lbs (stevia cost around 1-4$ a lb but cheaper with coupons)

5-7$ ish you can make 4-6 bottles of syrup depending on strength of coco you like + consistency (aka more or less water). Vs 3-4$ a bottle. 

I don't add salt but most recipes do. I use the microwave cuz I'm lazy but of you want a more smooth consistency you could cook in a pan. 

https://youtu.be/O0NuGvCL9CQ
Here's one recipe but there are many online with different ways still very cheap and tastier than premade imo 

You can mess around with mixtures, measurements, some use vanilla optional.

How to get enough protein from food with a longer expiry date? Any examples?,"Hi, I'm jobless, depressed, and hate cooking. I'm looking for ""dry"" protein sources I can keep in the pantry or fridge, preferably that I can eat without several cooking steps. Like eggs, peanut butter, sunseeds, nuts.

Any depressed vegetarians who have ideas for meal plans? What and how much do you eat when the only thing you want to do is eat toast and go back to bed?

I am looking into different foods to see what I would like, and also do the math on how much of each I need to eat. I just figured, maybe someone in here are on a similar diet and can provide any tips.

A bit more about me:

I get easily nauseated from my meds and that means things in the fridge easily go bad, because I avoid eating at all. I also am not a good judge of when food has gone bad, so I keep second guessing myself and avoid buying meat at all. TV dinners are where it's at for me, but that's not healthy or cheap.

I also have crohns, which in my case means my bowels  can suddenly decide ""No, I hate this food now, let's punish her with pain and bodily fluids"", and I need to figure out what I dare to eat. I also hate hummus, beans, quina and lentils, which from what I gather are some of the best non-meat alternatives. Which is just lovely, I love my tastebuds.

So, I need to sit down with a calculator and try to figure out ""If I take two eggs, a handful of nuts and dry swallow some seeds, will that be enough?""",1,"How to get enough protein from food with a longer expiry date?

Too depressed to eat right everyday. Can someone suggest vegan recipes for a protein shake and meals for three days a week for one day of weight training given that very few vegan proteins are available in my country?,"Non-native English speaker here. 

I am a 31 year old guy. I am 5 feet 4 and I weigh 56kg. I am out of home for work and with commute and office hours, its 70+ hours a week. I get out of bed at 7am, leave by 8am and return home at 10pm 5 days a week Sunday through Thursday. Friday is off and Saturday is training where I am out from 8am till 7pm. 

Now I am too depressed and I have too little time to exercise or eat healthily. I have recently decided to exercise on Friday for 1 hour: at least something is better than nothing. I got a workout routine from /r/EOOD. 

So now, I need a plan to cover the nutrients. At the moment, the only thing possible would be to drink a shake on Fri, Sat, Sun and to eat something full of proteins and all on Fri, Sat, Sun on any particular meal time (either at breakfast, lunch or dinner but not in all three). The rest of the meals would have to be what I regularly eat. Obsessively meal planning and eating nutritiously for every meal every day of the week is just plain impossible at the moment. 

I also prefer not to eat meat and I would rather go for something that is vegan. Now the problem is, beans and peas give me gas. And most vegan protein substitutes like quinoa, tofu are either not available in Bangladesh or expensive. 

Here is a list from an online grocer from where I buy groceries: https://chaldal.com/grocery

"Thinly sliced Brussels sprouts are amazing in stir-fries! I made this one with ground chicken, peanut butter, and sprouts...super easy and fast!","PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/67v2xyI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/67v2xyI.jpg)

This is such an easy udon recipe and it's SO good. I really liked the Brussels sprouts in this dish, even more than regular cabbage. Though, you could use shredded cabbage too! Or even sliced bok choy.

**Substitutions:**

**Udon:** Any noodle. Try it with soba, ramen, or rice noodles. Can also use pasta, like spaghetti or linguine in a pinch.

**Ground chicken:** Your favorite ground meat or use finely chopped tofu or store-bought tofu crumbles.

**Brussels sprouts:** Cabbage or bok choy

### Ingredients

* 16 ounces fresh, frozen, or dry udon
* ¼ cup vegetable oil divided plus more if needed
* 1 pound ground chicken
* 2 shallots peeled and minced
* 8 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts trimmed and thinly sliced
* ⅔ cup water
* ¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons peanut butter
* 1 tablespoon chili oil or sriracha plus more, to taste
* 1 tablespoon mirin
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For serving:

* Crushed peanuts optional

### Instructions

#### Cook the udon:

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the udon and cook according to package instructions. Drain, rinse and set aside.

#### Cook the chicken:

* Heat half the vegetable oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 8–12 minutes until it browns around the edges and is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the chicken to a bowl.

#### Cook the aromatics:

* Add the remaining oil. Add the shallot and cook for 3–5 minutes–often stirring–until it softens and begins to turn golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Transfer to the bowl of chicken.

#### Cook the Brussels sprouts:

* If needed, add another drizzle of oil. Add the Brussels sprouts and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 4–6 minutes until the sprouts begin to char around the edges. Stir regularly.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* As the Brussels sprouts cook, prepare the sauce. Whisk together the water or stock in a bowl with soy sauce, peanut butter, chili oil, mirin, and sesame oil. Set aside.

#### Finish the udon:

* Pour the sauce into the Brussels sprouts and bring to a boil for 2–3 minutes. Add the chicken, garlic, and shallot and toss to coat. Cook until the sauce thickens slightly.
* Add the cooked udon to the wok and toss to coat for 1-3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season the udon to your preferences.

#### To serve:

* Divide the cooked udon between bowls and garnish with crushed peanuts. Enjoy!",1,"Thinly sliced Brussels sprouts are amazing in stir-fries! I made this one with ground chicken, peanut butter, and sprouts...super easy and fast!PIC: [

I buy the small bowls of oatmeal you just add hot water to, I like snacking on avocados and kalamata olives... and when I want a sweet snack, I'll buy plantain chips.. That's really it... This doesn't seem like much but is actually expensive, I can spend $15-20 easily on food a day...

I’ve seen this topic come up on this sub a few times and figured I’d make a post on it. A lot of people post stuff like “I have $20 to last me until my first paycheck in 3 weeks, what should I eat?” I want to encourage you to look for food pantries in your area and use their services. 

All this is from my experience in a mid-sized US city; things may work differently elsewhere, but most of the general ideas still apply. 

**tl;dr if you think you could possibly benefit from visiting a food bank, food pantry, or other free/reduced cost food organization, please do.** The people who work there want you to use it. You are not “taking away” food from people who “need it more”, because 1) everyone needs and deserves to eat and 2) often there is enough or too much food—the resources food banks are short on are more to do with insufficient funding, and more clients = more money allocated to them.  

I have volunteered twice at a food pantry, but it is part of a larger organization I have volunteered at for years doing other food-related work (largely cooking and distributing hot meals), so I get to see how food donations come in and how we sort and allocate them. The organization I volunteer at serves a lot of needs in the community but one of their target populations is homeless youth, which is the demographic served by the hot meal program. The food pantry program serves a wider range of people (I started volunteering there because they need someone who speaks Spanish, and I’m unemployed now so the scheduling works out well). I also sometimes unload and sort donations from grocery stores and the city food bank, which in addition to providing food to individuals, also distributes it to other organizations throughout the city. 

Some things that I’ve noticed that might surprise people:

* we often have too much food. By this I mean we get donated much more food than we have the capacity to cook, or people do not take all the food we serve. 

* On the rare occasion we do run out of food, it is more likely that we didn’t plan to cook enough, or had an unexpected influx of clients; I can’t think of a time that the hot meal program ran out of raw ingredients. (The food pantry and hot meal program share ingredients and distribute them as needed.) 

* The food pantry will often run out of high-demand items like milk, eggs, and culturally specific staple foods (like masa harina amongst the Hispanic clients) but even when this happens there is often an excess of other items that are perfectly good, just a little less familiar. The food pantry had two huge boxes of bok choy go nearly untouched this week; it got distributed to other sites so it’s not going to waste, but people were preferring to take fruits and veggies they knew how to cook and that their families would recognize. We’ve had the same cans of puréed pumpkin sitting on the self for weeks; there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s just less familiar to people so they gravitate towards other items. 

* There are nice, high-quality foods available, including a mix of fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable foods. We get lots of donations from Whole Foods and local stores in a similar price range, so there are many vegan and gluten-free options available as well as some really tasty baked goods and ready-to-eat meals. This time of year, grocery stores are going overboard on cookies for the holidays, so we have lots of those, to the point where volunteers are encouraged to take them home because we can’t give them away fast enough. 

* Speaking of which—volunteers and staff eat the same food as clients, because it is good food. Nothing is gross or bad—sometimes it is past the sell-by date but we have government guidelines as to how long different items stay safe to eat past their sell-by dates. For example, we keep milk for a week after its sell-by date and throw it out after. A lot of stuff has not even reached its sell-by rate but has some minor issue like the package being dented, it’s still perfectly good to eat.  

* We are not judging you for using our services. If you have special needs like allergies or religious food restrictions, we will try to find something for you. Of course there are jerks working in every industry, but in general, if someone chooses to work or volunteer for a food pantry or other free food program, it is because they want to help, and believe everyone deserves enough to eat. 

In general, American grocery stores have tons of perfectly good ingredients they can’t sell for whatever reason, and we usually get more than enough donated. Where nonprofit food programs have shortages is often in other areas—they can’t hire enough full time staff to keep food pantries open more than a few hours a week, or pay their staff enough to prevent burnout and high turnover. Or they can’t afford equipment, vehicles, real estate, etc. The food itself is unlikely to be what’s limiting them; they need money, and nonprofits get funding based on use. By using the food pantry, you are directly contributing to them being able to get more funds and provide more/better services. It’s not a direct 1:1 relationship between clients and funding but they will put things like “x number of clients used our services this year” in grant applications, and a higher number will lead to more money for them.  

So please—if you are in the position of having to feed yourself and/or others with very little money, while this sub can be a great resource on how to do that cheaply, please please please see what is available in your community and do not hesitate to make use of it! It is there for you. You can always volunteer or donate in the future when you’re doing better; for now, you need to eat and you deserve to eat well, and we want to help you. 

Start by searching “food bank” or “free food” plus your zip code or city.

Easy chili? Is it possible with a slow cooker,"Hey all

I have some ground beef, spices of choice, lots of canned tomatoes, beans... And all the other stuff I put in my chili recipes when done on the stove.

Is it possible to just throw it all in a slow cooker and come back in a couple hours to a decent chili?

Obviously prep the onions and garlic etc... And it's extra lean beef so do I really need to cook it separately first? I would think it that has so little fat that it wouldn't matter much... But I'm used to using medium beef for stove top chili which I have to drain

Never tried the slow cooker chili thing. Want to do this tonight to prep for the rest of the week.

meatless Mondays (or any day really) -- veggie bowls for any budget,"&amp;#x200B;

[making mondays \(taste\) great again with allll the veggies!!](https://preview.redd.it/ew37wzkchd581.jpg?width=1530&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af799fa387216b53b0f293026f1b3dfb93386f0)

meat is always the most expensive ingredient in week day meals. For making meatless Mondays as flavorful as any other night of the week, you need all the veggie flavor profiles you can get -- the more the merrier :)

this is a great meal to make because you can roast all the veggies on one pan (minimal mess making), and throw whatever leftovers you have in your fridge on top. makes enough veggies for at least 3 bowls, so you’ll have lunch for the next two days. You can use frozen cauliflower or brussels if you're ballin' on a budget, just make sure to defrost before roasting!

**ingredients:**

* cauliflower
* brussel sprouts
* 1 sweet potato
* tomatoes
* cheese (I like goat)
* dressing
* spices for seasoning: salt, pepper, garlic
* optional: chili powder, cumin, curry powder, squeeze of lemon juice
* Other topping options: green onions, kale, cucumbers, roasted chickpeas, sesame seeds, balsamic glaze, croutons, literally any leftovers in your fridge

**recipe:** Preheat oven to 450. Cut Brussels in half and sweet potatoes into fourths, break up cauliflower florets into smaller pieces. Put everything onto a pan and drizzle with olive oil and salt. For the Brussels and cauliflower: also sprinkle garlic, pepper, and whatever other spices you want (I like cumin and chili &amp; curry powder on the cauliflower). bake the veggies for about 20-25 minutes, depending on desired crispiness. The sweet potatoes will need an extra ten minutes or so. When the veggies are done cooking, make your bowls! Toppings are essential, I always love tomatoes and cucumbers for some fresher flavors, plus goat cheese for some tanginess. Use whatever dressing you want on top to bring everything together — balsamic glaze/dressing always slaps!

I’d love to hear your suggestions for other veggies or toppings to add — especially if you have some suggestions to add crunch like croutons?? hope you all give it a try! :)",1,"meatless Mondays (or any day really) -- veggie bowls for any budget&amp;#x200B;

[making mondays \(taste\) great again with allll the veggies!!](

meat is always the most expensive ingredient in week day meals. For making meatless Mondays as flavorful as any other night of the week, you need all the veggie flavor profiles you can get -- the more the merrier :)

this is a great meal to make because you can roast all the veggies on one pan (minimal mess making), and throw whatever leftovers you have in your fridge on top. makes enough veggies for at least 3 bowls, so you’ll have lunch for the next two days. You can use frozen cauliflower or brussels if you're ballin' on a budget, just make sure to defrost before roasting!

**ingredients:**

* cauliflower
* brussel sprouts
* 1 sweet potato
* tomatoes
* cheese (I like goat)
* dressing
* spices for seasoning: salt, pepper, garlic
* optional: chili powder, cumin, curry powder, squeeze of lemon juice
* Other topping options: green onions, kale, cucumbers, roasted chickpeas, sesame seeds, balsamic glaze, croutons, literally any leftovers in your fridge

**recipe:** Preheat oven to 450. Cut Brussels in half and sweet potatoes into fourths, break up cauliflower florets into smaller pieces. Put everything onto a pan and drizzle with olive oil and salt. For the Brussels and cauliflower: also sprinkle garlic, pepper, and whatever other spices you want (I like cumin and chili &amp; curry powder on the cauliflower). bake the veggies for about 20-25 minutes, depending on desired crispiness. The sweet potatoes will need an extra ten minutes or so. When the veggies are done cooking, make your bowls! Toppings are essential, I always love tomatoes and cucumbers for some fresher flavors, plus goat cheese for some tanginess. Use whatever dressing you want on top to bring everything together — balsamic glaze/dressing always slaps!

I’d love to hear your suggestions for other veggies or toppings to add — especially if you have some suggestions to add crunch like croutons?? hope you all give it a try! :)"

Healthier Snacks,"So I'm a very picky eater, I try everything ofcourse, and for years I've tried alot of healthy foods but never stick with them because they either don't taste good enough to stick with, or it doesn't really fill me up at all and I will crave unhealthy snacks anyway.

I even tried just ignoring my hunger and eat less, but for some reason that will make me very tired and I even fall asleep at my desk at work.

Opinion on white flour,"As long as I live really, I'm always hearing how white flour is bad for health and how wholewheat is far better.

So I thought I should ask you guys, if you know, what's really the case?

I'm not talking about celiac disease, where you can't eat any of the two, but as a normal (#not) person, who exercises 6/7, eats very clean (like an athlete) and just wants to make some holiday desserts for family and friends (and myself of course!!!)

All of them don't like the healthier alternative and want traditional recipe. 

As for me, I take more than adequate fiber overall, so I suppose eating 1-2 biscuits a day (white flour, no sugar, just honey), won't raise blood sugar levels, or make me store fat, if I exercise as usual and burn those cals! (They may seem as overthinking, but I am coming from a long weight loss journey and I fear of ever going back!!!

We offer soft cooked vege portions but he’s only started to be interested in finger foods.

Unfortunately due to the business of parenthood and work etc, my partner and I have become quite lazy when it comes to our own nutrition, when we cook it’s meat and three veg and now we have fallen into the habit of frozen veg and chips and have been eating the same meals regularly (and sometimes takeaway.

I really don’t want to fall so deep into this habit and I want us to go back to fresh healthy meals as well as providing our son with nutritious solids and set a good example.

Carrot ricotta dumplings! You only need a few ingredients...a little time-consuming but a great way to use up carrots...the Recipe makes about 50 dumplings for around $6.50.,"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/sRSW4vg.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sRSW4vg.jpg)

Here's what you need:

* 1 ½ pounds carrots peeled and sliced into rounds ($2.69)
* 2 eggs ($.36)
* 16 ounces ricotta cheese ($2.89)
* 1¼ cup flour plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper

# Instructions:

#### Boil the carrots:

* Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the carrots and cook until completely soft. You should be able to mash them easily against the side of the pot.
* Drain the carrots through a sieve and run cold water over them. You can put a few ice cubes on top of the carrots to speed up the process. Once the carrots are cool enough to handle, use a potato masher to mash them until completely smooth. Alternatively, you can use a food processor or ricer.

#### Bring a pot of water to a boil:

* Wipe out the pot used to cook the carrots and fill it with water again. Transfer to the stovetop and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil.

#### Prepare the ricotta mixture:

* In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Add the ricotta and whisk until incorporated with the eggs—season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the dumpling mixture:

* Pour the ricotta over the carrots. Add the flour. Use a spoon or an electric hand-mixer to blend until combined. Do not overmix! The mixture should hold its shape but should not feel too doughy. It should still be a bit 'wet' from the ricotta. If the mixture feels too loose, add more flour in 1 tablespoon increments.

#### Taste the dumplings:

* Once the water is boiling, drop a small pinch of the dumpling mixture into the pot. Once it floats, take it out and taste it. Adjust the seasonings in your ricotta dumpling mixture to taste.

#### Boil the dumplings:

* Use a teaspoon to scoop a spoonful of the mixture and run the edge of the spoon against the inside of the bowl to form a quenelle shape. These need not be perfect. With the dumpling mixture still on your spoon, place the spoon right into the boiling water and shake it to loosen the dumpling off the spoon.
* Continue until you have about 5–6 dumplings in the pot. Allow them to boil for 3–4 minutes until they float. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a large plate once cooked through. Alternatively, you can roll the mixture into balls between your hands and drop them right into the water. Again, be careful not to over-roll them, or the dumpling will be tough.
* Continue boiling the dumplings in batches until all the dumplings have been cooked.

At this point, you can serve with your favorite sauce (I did maple-sage) like a butter sauce or even simple tomato sauce. Any remaining cooked and un-sauced dumplings can be frozen. Arrange them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and place them in the freezer for 3 hours. Once they are frozen, transfer them to a gallon freezer bag.

Mediterranean inspired chickpeas for meal prep,"Some sort of beans and rice is usually my go to for protein heavy/nutritious meal prep. Over the years I've tried to make what can be a really boring dish more interesting, and I feel like I've topped myself on this Sunday. I came up with by buying some random things at the store, with North Africa in mind, particularly shakshuka. And I'm pretty sure I drew from all over the Med here, including Italy and Greece. So please, don't come at me with ""tradition"". This is just a really cost effective, and delicious meal prep that, in my opinion, most novice cooks can make. I don't measure, but I'll give a list of ingredients I used with rough measurements. This style of cooking for me is very loose, so I apologize in advance. Also, I live in the US, so yes, I'll be using freedom units since that's how packages of food are labeled here. Also, this meal prep is great for vegetarians/vegans. I'm using some ingredients that would not be vegan, like anchovies and feta, but these obviously could be omitted and you'd still have something very delicious.

Bulk:

-Large package of white sliced button mushrooms, 12 oz

-Standard 1 lb bag of chickpeas, dried

-1 bag of spinach, 6 oz

-2 cans of Cento San Marzano tomatoes

Aromatics:

-Olive oil

-1 large onion

-3 poblano peppers

-2 serrano peppers

-Half a head of garlic, minced

-1 lemon

Spice:

-3ish tablespoons of smoked paprika (I wanted to use harissa, but they didn't have any at the store)

-1 tablespoon caraway seeds

-1 tablespoon cumin

-1 teaspoon ground coriander

-Red pepper flakes (I really like spice so I used a few tablespoons worth, most people I would imagine would put in maybe just one)

-3 bay leaves

Umami boosters:

-3 anchovies

-Tomato paste

Liquid:

-About a half bottle of white wine

-Water to rinse out cans

Garnish:

-Feta

-Basil

So this is a mixture of stuff I bought today, and things I had in the pantry already. I think I spent maybe 15 bucks (or maybe less) at the store today, and this makes at least eight servings, if not more. And honestly, you could omit the feta to cut out the cost a bit. Easily the most expensive thing I got today at the store, but it was worth it. So I'll go over my procedure.

Bean soaking:

I soaked the chickpeas overnight in cool tap water with like 3 pinches of kosher salt. I don't think you necessarily have to do this step, but beans/chickpeas cook quicker if they're soaked, and apparently soaking with salt improves texture according to people on the internet I've read/heard, while also seasoning the chickpea. If you didn't plan ahead, you'll probably just need to cook the chickpeas longer. Make sure you put in more water than you think is necessary. I'm always amazed to how big beans and chickpeas get when soaking, and you don't want them peeking out above the water overnight.

Aromatic base:

I really like mushrooms in all of my stews/braises/bean prep for added meatiness and texture. I also like them because I kind of use them like a cured pork product to start the base of a sauce, similar to frying some pancetta to start a ragu. But don't feel like you need to do this if you don't like mushrooms. I start by throwing the mushrooms in my enameled dutch oven with some water on medium heat, and throw in a pinch of salt. The goal here is to draw out as much water as possible and then to evaporate the water. Once the water is mostly gone (this will take a bit, maybe like 10 minutes for me), put in enough olive oil to allow the mushrooms to brown (ghee would be good here too). I'm still using medium heat, and I give enough time to brown without touching. During this whole process is when I'm cutting my onions, peppers, garlic, and getting the rest of my stuff ready. Once the browning smell becomes apparent (took me around 5-7 minutes), move mushrooms around and try and flip as many as possible. Brown a little bit more, then remove. I put the mushrooms in a bowl, covered with a plate and stuck in the fridge. In leftover fat and fond, throw in chopped up onions and peppers with a pinch of salt to draw out water. Still medium heat. Scrape bottom with a wooden spoon to deglaze fond so it doesn't burn. Allow vegetables to sweat out moisture, took about 10 minutes for me.

Umami boosting and spice frying:

Once the vegetables have sweated, I like to make a well in the center by moving the vegetables to the edges, and add in oil to coat that space. Then in separate spots in that well I like to add in this order: anchovies, spices, tomatoes paste, garlic. Anchovies I like to give 4 minutes frying, spices 3 minutes, tomatoes paste 2 minutes, garlic 1 minutes; so each minute I'm adding the next thing. The reason I do it in this order is because now we're at risk of burning if care isn't being used. The spices are fat soluble, but given the powdered nature, it could get hairy if overdone. The tomato paste needs to cook out to get rid of the metallic taste of the tube, but it's full of sugar and sugar can burn very fast. And fine garlic goes from golden and nice to black and burned in like 10 seconds. Anchovies I've never really had an issue with, but I like to give them a little frying before the liquid comes. Also, don't be afraid of anchovies. It's not essential, but it really kicks up the savoryness of food. I think I heard Chef John call anchovies Italian msg, and I totally agree. It will not make your food taste fishy, I promise. Also, the spices I fried were the paprika, cumin, coriander, and caraway.

After frying (when the garlic is fragrant), I like to stir everything around. Probably not necessary, but I just like to do it.

Liquid:

I deglazed with the rest of a bottle of white wine I had leftover (around 350 mL). I always have Woodbridge Pinot Grigio for my all purpose cooking wine. It sucks as a drinking wine, but perfect for cooking. I've heard that you don't want to cook with wine you wouldn't drink, but I'm calling bullshit. I'm not going to notice the nuisances from wine in food. However, if you don't want to use wine, any stock would work. Veggie stock for vegans. Animal stock if you want. Once that's in, scrape any fond up from the vegetables. Then add the tomatoes. Rinse out cans to get all of the tomato water out of the can and add. This is a lot of liquid, but I tend to cook things like this for a long time and it will reduce. Then while bringing to a boil, I add bay leaves and red pepper flakes. These things steep like tea, and are perfect for adding during the liquid phase. Maybe the flakes could be fried, but I never do.

Simmer and blend:

Bring to a boil on high, then reduce to simmer. On my 1-9 stovetop, I find that 3 is perfect for simmering. Every stovetop is different though. Now I just like to have this chilling on the stove for hours. I started at 10 this morning, and simmered until 6:30. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't dry out. Add water when necessary. Eventually everything in that pot is going to fall apart. Some people would strain the solids out, but I like to take them to my advantage. So instead of straining and thickening the liquid later, I just get an immersion blender and blend until smooth. You get a really nice smooth, thick sauce and retain all of the fiber, which is good for you. Totally not necessary though. I usually do this like an hour before I plan to eat. Remove bay leaves before you blend.

Cook chickpeas:

I drain the chickpeas with a colander, and then put in a pot and cover with fresh water. Bring to boil, then cook for 30 minutes while skimming off the foam that rises. After the timer goes off, I test a chickpea. If it's creamy, and maybe even a little overdone, it's perfect. Starches harden when they cool, so overshooting the mark usually gets me the perfect texture at eating temperature. If it's not done after 30 minutes, then I check in 3 minute increments. Really shouldn't take more than 45 minutes, but test just to make sure. If you didn't soak your beans, an hour is probably minimum, but maybe test after 50 minutes. 

Finishing touches:

Once everything is ready, I add the chickpeas to the sauce along with the mushrooms from the fridge. Ideally the sauce is drier than I want it right now, so I can adjust the liquid level at the end. During this time, I also added an entire bag of spinach to up the nutrition. It's going to look like way too much at first, but keep faith and keep stirring the spinach in, and it'll melt into the sauce. Once everything is in, zest the lemon, and add half of the lemon juice. Taste and assess the acid level. If it needs more, add the other half of the lemon juice. Add water to desired sauce thickness. Now is the time for salinity assessment. Taste and adjust for salt until you like it. I usually find that with big pots of sauces/stews/beans, they need A LOT of salt. I start with two four finger pinches of kosher, then keep adjusting. However, I think my salt tolerance is high, so use your own discretion.

Plate and garnish: 

To serve, I had some leftover basmati rice that I just threw in the microwave for a minute. Then I spooned some of the chickpeas and sauce in a bowl on top of the rice. Then I topped with a few leaves of basil that I rolled up did a chiffonade on. I chose basil because it's my favorite herb, but I think a multitude of herbs would be nice. Cilantro, mint, parsley, maybe tarragon could all work here. I topped with some feta that I crumbled off the block. I used Mevgal, and it's fucking delicious. I'm used to cheaper feta that tends to be dry. But if you can buck up the cash, it's worth getting the fancy cheese.

I'm not really a photographer, but I wanted to show how it looked. It was a very satisfying dinner, and will be a for a while.

That's it. I don't expect anyone to make this the same exact way that I did. But if this give others idea of what they'd like to do with a bean/chickpeas meal prep, then I'll be happy. I love food like this, especially during the winter months since I feel warmed up while eating it. Hope everyone reading has a pleasant end of the year, and well wish to you and yours.",1,"Mediterranean inspired chickpeas for meal prepSome sort of beans and rice is usually my go to for protein heavy/nutritious meal prep. Over the years I've tried to make what can be a really boring dish more interesting, and I feel like I've topped myself on this Sunday. I came up with by buying some random things at the store, with North Africa in mind, particularly shakshuka. And I'm pretty sure I drew from all over the Med here, including Italy and Greece. So please, don't come at me with ""tradition"". This is just a really cost effective, and delicious meal prep that, in my opinion, most novice cooks can make. I don't measure, but I'll give a list of ingredients I used with rough measurements. This style of cooking for me is very loose, so I apologize in advance. Also, I live in the US, so yes, I'll be using freedom units since that's how packages of food are labeled here. Also, this meal prep is great for vegetarians/vegans. I'm using some ingredients that would not be vegan, like anchovies and feta, but these obviously could be omitted and you'd still have something very delicious.

Bulk:

-Large package of white sliced button mushrooms, 12 oz

-Standard 1 lb bag of chickpeas, dried

-1 bag of spinach, 6 oz

-2 cans of Cento San Marzano tomatoes

Aromatics:

-Olive oil

-1 large onion

-3 poblano peppers

-2 serrano peppers

-Half a head of garlic, minced

-1 lemon

Spice:

-3ish tablespoons of smoked paprika (I wanted to use harissa, but they didn't have any at the store)

-1 tablespoon caraway seeds

-1 tablespoon cumin

-1 teaspoon ground coriander

-Red pepper flakes (I really like spice so I used a few tablespoons worth, most people I would imagine would put in maybe just one)

-3 bay leaves

Umami boosters:

-3 anchovies

-Tomato paste

Liquid:

-About a half bottle of white wine

-Water to rinse out cans

Garnish:

-Feta

-Basil

So this is a mixture of stuff I bought today, and things I had in the pantry already. I think I spent maybe 15 bucks (or maybe less) at the store today, and this makes at least eight servings, if not more. And honestly, you could omit the feta to cut out the cost a bit. Easily the most expensive thing I got today at the store, but it was worth it. So I'll go over my procedure.

Bean soaking:

I soaked the chickpeas overnight in cool tap water with like 3 pinches of kosher salt. I don't think you necessarily have to do this step, but beans/chickpeas cook quicker if they're soaked, and apparently soaking with salt improves texture according to people on the internet I've read/heard, while also seasoning the chickpea. If you didn't plan ahead, you'll probably just need to cook the chickpeas longer. Make sure you put in more water than you think is necessary. I'm always amazed to how big beans and chickpeas get when soaking, and you don't want them peeking out above the water overnight.

Aromatic base:

I really like mushrooms in all of my stews/braises/bean prep for added meatiness and texture. I also like them because I kind of use them like a cured pork product to start the base of a sauce, similar to frying some pancetta to start a ragu. But don't feel like you need to do this if you don't like mushrooms. I start by throwing the mushrooms in my enameled dutch oven with some water on medium heat, and throw in a pinch of salt. The goal here is to draw out as much water as possible and then to evaporate the water. Once the water is mostly gone (this will take a bit, maybe like 10 minutes for me), put in enough olive oil to allow the mushrooms to brown (ghee would be good here too). I'm still using medium heat, and I give enough time to brown without touching. During this whole process is when I'm cutting my onions, peppers, garlic, and getting the rest of my stuff ready. Once the browning smell becomes apparent (took me around 5-7 minutes), move mushrooms around and try and flip as many as possible. Brown a little bit more, then remove. I put the mushrooms in a bowl, covered with a plate and stuck in the fridge. In leftover fat and fond, throw in chopped up onions and peppers with a pinch of salt to draw out water. Still medium heat. Scrape bottom with a wooden spoon to deglaze fond so it doesn't burn. Allow vegetables to sweat out moisture, took about 10 minutes for me.

Umami boosting and spice frying:

Once the vegetables have sweated, I like to make a well in the center by moving the vegetables to the edges, and add in oil to coat that space. Then in separate spots in that well I like to add in this order: anchovies, spices, tomatoes paste, garlic. Anchovies I like to give 4 minutes frying, spices 3 minutes, tomatoes paste 2 minutes, garlic 1 minutes; so each minute I'm adding the next thing. The reason I do it in this order is because now we're at risk of burning if care isn't being used. The spices are fat soluble, but given the powdered nature, it could get hairy if overdone. The tomato paste needs to cook out to get rid of the metallic taste of the tube, but it's full of sugar and sugar can burn very fast. And fine garlic goes from golden and nice to black and burned in like 10 seconds. Anchovies I've never really had an issue with, but I like to give them a little frying before the liquid comes.

Stock/broth tastes watery?,So I’ve been saving up chicken bones and scraps and vegetable scraps to make some good stock/broth. I’ve accumulated quite a lot and added only enough water to barely cover the ingredients. Somehow my end result was still very disappointing and I’m wondering what I did wrong? In the end I added stock cubes to enhance the flavor because it tasted like slightly flavored water. Pretty disappointed in the outcome and I don’t think it was worth to collect all these scraps for that result.,1,Stock/broth tastes watery?So I’ve been saving up chicken bones and scraps and vegetable scraps to make some good stock/broth.

Feels like I’m eating a lot of protein but in reality I’m not. How do you guys hit your protein goal so easily?,"Typically my breakfast will be 4 scrambled eggs with one or two chicken sausages (13g per) and something like a muffin on the side.

meatless Mondays (or any day really) -- veggie bowls for any budget,"&amp;#x200B;

[one pan roasted veggie bowls](https://preview.redd.it/yk268opsgs481.jpg?width=1530&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7769f0f102db5d949b845cd94ee664cdb0ed56e8)

meat is always the most expensive ingredient in week day meals. For making meatless Mondays as flavorful as any other night of the week, you need all the veggie flavor profiles you can get -- the more the merrier :)

this is a great meal to make because you can roast all the veggies on one pan (minimal mess making), and throw whatever leftovers you have in your fridge on top. makes enough veggies for at least 3 bowls, so you’ll have lunch for the next two days. You can use frozen cauliflower or brussels if you're ballin' on a budget, just make sure to defrost before roasting!

**ingredients:** 

* cauliflower
* brussel sprouts
* 1 sweet potato 
* tomatoes
* cheese (I like goat) 
* dressing
* spices for seasoning: salt, pepper, garlic
* optional: chili powder, cumin, curry powder, squeeze of lemon juice
* Other topping options: green onions, kale, cucumbers, roasted chickpeas, sesame seeds, balsamic glaze, croutons, literally any leftovers in your fridge 

**recipe:** Preheat oven to 450. Cut Brussels in half and sweet potatoes into fourths, break up cauliflower florets into smaller pieces. Put everything onto a pan and drizzle with olive oil and salt. For the Brussels and cauliflower: also sprinkle garlic, pepper, and whatever other spices you want (I like cumin and chili &amp; curry powder on the cauliflower). bake the veggies for about 20-25 minutes, depending on desired crispiness. The sweet potatoes will need an extra ten minutes or so. When the veggies are done cooking, make your bowls! Toppings are essential, I always love tomatoes and cucumbers for some fresher flavors, plus goat cheese for some tanginess. Use whatever dressing you want on top to bring everything together — balsamic glaze/dressing always slaps! 

I’d love to hear your suggestions for other veggies or toppings to add — especially if you have some suggestions to add crunch like croutons?? hope you all give it a try! :) if you like this vibe, feel free to check out more of my budget recipes [here](https://amoochlife.com/pages/budget-food-recipes)!!!",1,"meatless Mondays (or any day really) -- veggie bowls for any budget&amp;#x200B;

"What herbs, greens, etc. can you regrow with plain water, and for how long?","Heya guys, not sure the best place to post this but figured renewable herb and veggie sources fall under eating cheap.


Every few months, I’ll have a couple weeks where I’m obsessed with foods I can top with spring onion (green onions for my US friends), which is great, because I usually just have to buy a bunch and keep the roots with some white attached and put in a cup of water, and it’ll often regrow 5-6 times without ever needing anything but good old H2O.

I hate paying $3 every time I want to use coriander, but unfortunately I might get half a regrow tops before it gives out. I don’t use too many other fresh herbs for the same money factor, but was wondering if anyone had had any positive experiences with any other foods you can regenerate for free at home without the need for soil?

Cheers!",1,"What herbs, greens, etc. can you regrow with plain water, and for how long?Heya guys, not sure the best place to post this but figured renewable herb and veggie sources fall under eating cheap.


Every few months, I’ll have a couple weeks where I’m obsessed with foods I can top with spring onion (green onions for my US friends), which is great, because I usually just have to buy a bunch and keep the roots with some white attached and put in a cup of water, and it’ll often regrow 5-6 times without ever needing anything but good old H2O.

I hate paying $3 every time I want to use coriander, but unfortunately I might get half a regrow tops before it gives out. I don’t use too many other fresh herbs for the same money factor, but was wondering if anyone had had any positive experiences with any other foods you can regenerate for free at home without the need for soil?

What are some things/meals I can quickly eat while working from home?,"Even though I work from home, I find that I often do not have time to stop for meal breaks. My schedule goes like this: wake up at 7:30am, take my daughter to school at 8am, come home and immediately work until 3pm, which is when I pick her up. Yes, I typically work through lunch hours and when I pick her up at 3, I’m usually so hungry that we would get fast food or take out, spending at least $15. This adds up and it’s not even anything memorable. I’m trying to eat cheaply during the week and maintain a budget for dining out only for weekends. 

I think if I take time out of the work day to eat properly then I wouldn’t need to spend this extra money. Aside from making bigger dinner portions to have leftovers for lunch, what’s something I can easily prepare?
I’m going to Costco tomorrow (or anywhere is fine) and hoping I can buy something in bulk to have for the work day.

Fasting for budget and weight loss,"So I've been fasting for both my budget and weight loss and it has done wonders! 

I do a dirty fast for 3 days out of the week (dirty fast meaning having homemade broth or a small salad with lemon juice as dressing)and eat very healthy the other 4 days While also eating enough calories. I aim for roughly 1900 calories on my 4 off days.  

I started doing this because 1, I'm overweight af. Covid did me dirty in more ways than 1. And I went from roughly 140 to 215 and then got super depressed because, well, I gained over 60 pounds none of my clothes fit and I don't look like me.   
 
But also because I'm broke af. We talking 30$ a week for groceries broke. And beans, rice and pasta (the cheap bulk items) seem to make the weight stick no matter how deficit I go calorie wise.  
 
So instead of spreading my 30$ across the week and eating a lot of 'filler' meals (stuff that doesn't agree with me: beans, rice, bread, pasta) I use that 30$ for 4 days worth of very healthy meals that my body loves. Salmon, pork, chicken, leafy greens, root veg, avacado, nuts; the good good stuff.  
  
I've been steadily losing 1.5 pounds a week this way. The real amazing thing has been my mood changes. I'm less groggy, fatigued and less irritable. I actually have a sex drive again. 
  
Anyways, it's not feasible for everyone and you might wanna talk to a doctor before starting longer fasts especially if you have medical issues, but it works for me so I thought I'd share.",1,"Fasting for budget and weight lossSo I've been fasting for both my budget and weight loss and it has done wonders!

Extremely depressed and looking to improve food habits,"So i suffer from depression and have noticed that it gets worse depending on my diet consistency and every time I have a good day I go to the grocery store buy a ton of salads/fresh fruits and veggies and end up throwing them out 
My medications make me not hungry at all which makes it harder to be on a schedule + i tried to counter by getting Soylent and frozen foods but I want to be healthier and get into meal prep. The last couple times I tried meal prepping the food tasted weird and that meant I had wasted a week’s worth of ingredients and energy and got very sad :( I’m also not a good cook and always scared of getting salmonella or something and overcook the chicken. 
Are there any easy recipes I can follow to the t (maybe just adding ingredients to an instant pot and leaving it for a couple of houss) that will still be healthy and doesn’t taste gross? 
I have read other posts about depression meals but most of the comments are like hey you can take like 4 ingredients and make a burrito and I always mess it up. Are there any recipes you can link to/videos that dumb it down cause I don’t even know the basics and live alone and have just been feeling very helpless about it all :(

Lean chicken pasta sauce,"I just made this up from stuff I had sitting around so I don’t have prices for any of it but nothing was too expensive.

Ingredients: 

Olive oil (or oil of your choice just not motor oil)
1/2 white onion (diced)
2 cans diced tomatoes
1 can tomato sauce
1 cup of chopped baby Bella mushroom (or mushroom of your choice) 
2 cloves garlic (crushed)
1/4 cup chicken stock
Shake of dried oregano, red pepper flake, paprika
1lb ground chicken
Salt and pepper to taste
Pasta of your choice

Directions:
1. Preheat a large saucepan over medium heat and add a splash of olive oil 
2. Add your ground chicken to the pan in the whole brick and let it get a little crispy on one side, flip, repeat, remove from the pan, and wipe it out
3. Add another splash of olive oil and wait until the oil shimmers
4. Add onion and mushroom to the pan along with a fat pinch of salt to draw out moisture 
5. Once the onions are translucent crush in 2 cloves of garlic and sautée until the raw garlic smell goes away
6. Clear a space in the pan and add your red pepper flake to toast for like 20 seconds
7. Mix everything together and add your diced tomatoes chicken and chicken stock
8. Break apart the chicken and leave uncovered until the sauce has thickened, stirring occasionally. (This took about 20-30 minutes over medium heat)
9. Put on water for the pasta and salt it up
10. Once the sauce is reduced add the can of tomato sauce, paprika, black pepper and oregano and stir to combine. Reduce heat to low 
11. Once boiling add dry pasta to the water (I used this red lentil and quinoa pasta that’s been sitting in the pantry forever. It’s actually really good and has a decent amount of protein but is more expensive than normal pasta) 
12. Cook pasta to al dente, save 1/4 cup of pasta water and drain
13. Add pasta and pasta water to the sauce then stir and taste for seasoning
14. Top with whatever you want (fresh herbs, Parmesan or nutritional yeast would all work wonderfully)
15. Enjoy!!

Things you can skip to save time or money:

You don’t need to present the chicken

You don’t need to add chicken stock as it makes it take longer to reduce

Fun rice and noodle alternatives!,"To me, a meal just isn't complete without some form of noodles or rice.

 I grew up eating rice my entire life, we buy it in big bags. For me, it's less about feeling full, and needing something to soak up or eat to compliment others parts of the meal, such as your meat, saucy vegetables etc.

So, I've started experimenting with different ways to create small little somethings, similar to rice, but not rice. Of course you have your standard barley, wheat, quinoa, grits, couscous, grits, etc.

But one of my favorite things to do is create my own. Take a head of cauliflower or broccoli, and throw it in the food processor or blender. Whip it up, and now you have texturally, rice. But flavor-wise, broccoli or cauliflower, effectively adding more vegetables to your diet. 

Can do the same with a potato, throw it in a masher, and you get similar results. Barley is great as well, and freekah. Just having something texturally similar to rice will help you feel more full. Try it with eggplant as well. I find this trick works if the vegetables are dry and texturally sound or hard. 

Maybe you're like me, and you enjoy noodles! Maybe even more so then rice! Gasps. Then the world of possibilitys is endless.

Take carrots, and use a vegetable peeler to grate them. Save the skins for soup. But use the inside for long, spaghetti, carrot noodles. Fry them in butter. Yum. 

Can do the same for zucchini, so you have a color of explosion. That's literally where the name zoodles come from.

Take eggplant, bell peppers, cut them in noodle like shapes and fry. They'll become pliable and noodle like.

My favorite is red cabbage or regular green cabbage. Super cheap and a head can last a long time in freezer. If you cut the cabbage in strips, you can use them as noodles. Same for bean sprouts.

These rice and noodles work best in stir fries, or lightly fried in butter. Cook them too long, and it'll act like a vegetable of course. Don't put them in soup expecting them to soak up extra liquid. They're rice and noodle alternatives.

Easy peasy spicy broccoli/mushroom/parmesan/eggs breakfast bowl,"You can use any quick cooking veggies you like in this: I use broccoli florets from a whole head and cremini mushrooms.

Cut up the broccoli to bite size, cut a whole jalapeno as small as you feel like it, toss in a nonstick skillet over medium heat with some mushrooms until done to your liking. Keep in mind you can crowd the skillet a bit at the beginning because they'll get smaller. At this point, add a bunch of fresh ground salt and pepper and as much parmesan as you can reasonably justify to yourself. Stir up and move veggies to one side so you can fry up some eggs. Don't worry if some parmesan crisps on the bottom- that's the best part.

Frozen low calorie meals not available today...,"Do any of you remember back when Lean Cuisine had the ""boil in the bag"" meals?

Substitution suggestions!

* **Celery and onion:** Load up on your favorite aromatic! Try it with garlic, leeks, carrots, or shallot, or add diced peppers!
* **Butter beans:** Any white bean, like cannellini, navy, or great northern beans.
* **Shredded bok choy:** Try it with your favorite soup green, like spinach, kale, escarole, or arugula.
* **Green beans:** Add your favorite fresh or frozen veggie here. Sugar snap peas would be delicious! You can also add cauliflower or even sweet potatoes, but add them with the beans and adjust the cooking time to ensure they cook all the way. If using heartier veg, hold the pearl couscous until they are almost cooked through, and then add the pearl couscous. 
* **Fresh dill:** Finish this soup with your favorite herb! Try it with parsley, basil, or minced scallions. Or add a sprinkle of dry parsley instead!
* **Pearl couscous:** Rice or any small pasta, like orzo or ditalini; adjust cooking time as needed.
* **Crème Fraîche:** Finish with a dollop of sour cream, Greek yogurt, or a splash of heavy cream. It's optional so you can skip it if you prefer.

Easy meals for the entire day,"Aside from eating cheap and healthy I also like to eat with minimal effort and cleanup. I only cook with a frying pan. I get enough variation through alternating lunch and dinner options, and also eating out. Here is my usual day - 

Breakfast - Oatmeal: 1/3 cup quick cooking oats, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup water... combine and microwave for 1:30. Add a drizzle of maple syrup and a spoon of brown sugar and stir. Side options include hardboiled eggs and fruit. 

Morning Snack - Juice Shake: Add baby spinach and pre-packaged frozen fruit to a blender, 50:50 ratio and fill about 2/3rd full. Then fill with OJ and water, using a little bit more OJ than water. Keeps sugar down and saves on OJ.

Lunch - Bread and cheese: You might spend a little more on higher quality breads and cheeses from the deli, still cheaper than lunch meat which isn't that healthy anyways. You don't need meat for every meal. But yeah I just spread/put cheese on bread and dunk it in olive oil. Can try other spreads too like hummus or olive tapenade. lots of variation possible here.

Afternoon snack - Random: Apples, pistachios, grapes, protein shake. Call it a wild card.

Dinner - I Mainly make two dinners which I alternate between, Beef burritos and chicken shawarma. Both using tortillas and can be cooked in one pan. I also get leftovers for the next day. 

For the beef burritos: Brown ground beef (90/10+ if you don't want to drain) in pan on medium heat, then run just enough water to be able to stir in seasoning (packets always say to add too much imo), add taco seasoning packet and a spoon of corn starch, keep stirring as you slowly turn down heat over about 5 minutes and give it a taste test. From here I heat the tortilla, add cooked beef, mexican blended cheese, and taco bell sauce but toppings are up to you. I figure I get enough nutrition earlier in the day so I usually just keep it simple.

For the chicken shawarma: I buy chicken breast in bulk and then cut it up into bite sized pieces. Then add about 2-3 spoons of premade shawarma marinade (I like the one from Whole Foods, go there just for that) into some ziploc bags. After that add chicken. close the bags and mix marinade with chicken in bag by mushing it around with your hands. Freeze and thaw as needed. Once thawed remix the bag again and let it sit at room temp for 30 minutes before cooking. Add a dash of cooking oil (don't use olive) to a pan and turn the heat to HIGH (notch or two below max). Add the chicken to the pan and stir/flip frequently. Add whatever seasoning, I use a premix like Johnny's. It should get a nice blackening/seer in a few minutes, once it does turn the heat down just a notch or two and cook for another few minutes. Check that there is no pink. Heat some tortillas and add Hummus and baba ghanoush. Then add cooked chicken. Then add cut up spicy pickles. 

I hope this gave you some ideas. Please share if you have any interesting tweaks to anything I mentioned.",1,"Easy meals for the entire dayAside from eating cheap and healthy I also like to eat with minimal effort and cleanup.

You don't need meat for every meal. But yeah I just spread/put cheese on bread and dunk it in olive oil. Can try other spreads too like hummus or olive tapenade. lots of variation possible here.

Afternoon snack - Random: Apples, pistachios, grapes, protein shake. Call it a wild card.

Dinner - I Mainly make two dinners which I alternate between, Beef burritos and chicken shawarma. Both using tortillas and can be cooked in one pan. I also get leftovers for the next day. 

For the beef burritos: Brown ground beef (90/10+ if you don't want to drain) in pan on medium heat, then run just enough water to be able to stir in seasoning (packets always say to add too much imo), add taco seasoning packet and a spoon of corn starch, keep stirring as you slowly turn down heat over about 5 minutes and give it a taste test. From here I heat the tortilla, add cooked beef, mexican blended cheese, and taco bell sauce but toppings are up to you. I figure I get enough nutrition earlier in the day so I usually just keep it simple.

For the chicken shawarma: I buy chicken breast in bulk and then cut it up into bite sized pieces. Then add about 2-3 spoons of premade shawarma marinade (I like the one from Whole Foods, go there just for that) into some ziploc bags. After that add chicken. close the bags and mix marinade with chicken in bag by mushing it around with your hands. Freeze and thaw as needed. Once thawed remix the bag again and let it sit at room temp for 30 minutes before cooking. Add a dash of cooking oil (don't use olive) to a pan and turn the heat to HIGH (notch or two below max). Add the chicken to the pan and stir/flip frequently. Add whatever seasoning, I use a premix like Johnny's. It should get a nice blackening/seer in a few minutes, once it does turn the heat down just a notch or two and cook for another few minutes. Check that there is no pink. Heat some tortillas and add Hummus and baba ghanoush. Then add cooked chicken. Then add cut up spicy pickles. 

I hope this gave you some ideas. Please share if you have any interesting tweaks to anything I mentioned."

Cheap Meal ideas that don’t involve rice or a lot of bread...,"My reactive hypoglycemia has gotten pretty bad in the last couple months and while I used to be able to handle portions of grains like brown rice etc, i no longer seem to be able to handle much of them. My blood sugar crashes and will go to ~50 and possibly even lower as I don’t always test. 

I used to think that pairing the grain with the right amount of protein/fat did the trick but even that is causing me issues. It seems that I can handle beans OK in smaller portions as long as I don’t have any other carbs with it, same with lentils, if that helps. But meat is expensive and I don’t eat much dairy bc of stomach issues that it gives me so I feel a bit stuck as grains are very cheap. 

Would appreciate any ideas for snacks or any meals. I can handle Ezekiel bread but try not to eat much of it bc $6 for a loaf does not vibe with me.",1,"Cheap Meal ideas that don’t involve rice or a lot of bread...My reactive hypoglycemia has gotten pretty bad in the last couple months and while I used to be able to handle portions of grains like brown rice etc, i no longer seem to be able to handle much of them.

"Blacken your meats for a quick, healthy and flavorful meal.","So I've been trying to eat more lean meat while cutting back on fried foods and heavy sauces. I've managed to do this by mixing a lot of blackened meats into my diet. Blackening uses extremely high heat and is generally pretty quick, while using only enough oil (preferably avocado) to keep the protein from sticking. The process was originally meant for fish, but can be used on chicken, shrimp, or even pork. I recommend Using Paul Prudhomme's Redfish Magic, as far as I know it was actually Prudhomme who invented the blackening process and this stuff is better than the options put out by other companies. I highly recommend this underrated cooking method to anyone looking to add a lot of flavor to their food without adding excess calories. 

One caveat: make sure you have a functional vent hood if trying to cook a lot at one time.

Currently in a 500cal deficit.Thanks to this sub right here, I've learned to re-portion myself and not overeat, and in a month I've dropped ~8-10lbs. I walk 9-10k steps/day at work, and my water intake is up to 40oz+/day. I track everything I eat and consistently come in under my cal goal of 1764, often by 100-300cal saved.

What green blends best with a chocolate smoothie?,"Just picked up a nutribullet and I want to start doing smoothies for breakfast. I plan on throwing in:

* 1/3 cup oats for the carbs + a little fibre
* 1 scoop choc whey powder for the protein
* 1 tablespoon peanut butter to get some fat in there and try to slow the glycemic response

Now I'm just looking for a relatively cheap green so I can add some more fibre without increasing the carbs too much. I was thinking either spinach or kale, but even with those two I don't know if I should be buying the ones from the freezer, or the ones in the bag. And can I just throw them in raw straight from the bag?",1,"What green blends best with a chocolate smoothie?Just picked up a nutribullet and I want to start doing smoothies for breakfast.

Fruit: Apples, Oranges, Pinapple, Pears, Mangoes, Bananas, Frozen Strawberries etc.

Vegetables: Also rotate, right now have baby carrots, tomatoes, kale, lettuce, Napa cabbage, cucumber, zucchini , etc.

Protein: Canned chickpeas, black beans, protein powder (optimum nutrition double rich chocolate), Greek yogurt, canned sardines and tuna, egg whites, 98% lean ground turkey 

Carbs: Sweet potato, white potato, brown rice, ezikel bread, oats.

Other: Bone broth, chicken broth, artificial sweeteners (swerve and Truvia packets) Walden farms (pancake, blueberry, chocolate, Carmel), general seasonings, vanilla extract, Xanthan gum, cocoa powder, almond milk, cinnamon, chia seeds. 

I’m not super limited on calories, aiming for 400-500 total (with the fruit.) I’m not sure exactly which fruit I should mix in overnight (should I?), what fruit to add, flavor ideas, etc. I’m getting PE science cake pop protein soon, so I’ll try that. I am considering getting PB Fit pure peanut. I might sub out the protein powder for the yogurt.

"Minestrone Soup: easy, cheap, healthy and could be vegan.","I made this for the first time recently and couldn’t believe how easy it was. 

Ingredients
- 1 rasher bacon (diced) (optional)
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- Red chilli flakes to taste (optional, not traditionally included)
- 1 onion (chopped fine)
- 1 cup carrots (julienne or diced)
- 1 celery stick (chopped finely)
- 4 baby leeks (halved and chopped roughly)
- 1 potato (cubed) (optional)
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp oregano 
- 500ml veggie stock
- 1 can cannellini beans (drained)
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 50g - 100g small pasta (optional)
- Salt and pepper to season

Method
- Fry up the bacon. 
- Add oil, lower heat to medium and add onion, carrot, celery, leeks, garlic, chilli, oregano and the bay leaf. Allow to soften (10-15 minutes). 
- Add the potato, beans, tomato and veggie stock. Simmer for 20 minutes (or until the potato is soft, if you’re using potatoes). You want the flavour in the tomato to become less acidic.
- Add pasta and keep on the heat until just before the pasta takes on the texture you like. Remove from the heat and, if you’re fussy, decant into another container to prevent the pasta overcooking. 
- Season with salt and pepper. 

Notes
- Exclude the bacon and use egg free pasta for a vegan recipe.
- Play around with the amount of aromatics (I often use extra oregano). 
- Keep the potato and pasta out for something more low calorie. 
- Add chickpeas as a sub for the beans (or use whatever bean you like). Or use a combo. 
- Use fresh tomatoes as a cheaper option, but you may need to add a little extra stock there. 
- Add spinach or kale at the end for greens. 
- Watch out that you don’t overdo the pasta, it can wind absorbing all the soup juice. 
- Especially if you don’t use pasta, serve with warm toast.",1,"Minestrone Soup: easy, cheap, healthy and could be vegan.I made this for the first time recently and couldn’t believe how easy it was.

Greek yoghurt but make it a sweet snack!,"I know this is common in healthy eating communities but its my recent fave so I decided to share. It's helped curb my dessert cravings. Here it is:

-A full bowl of Greek yoghurt

Need help with a beet salad recipe!,"There's a subpar Italian all-you-can-eat buffet in Colorado called Cinzetti's, and they have the absolute best cold beet salad.

Help me figure out the cheapest chicken chunks possible!,"I don't usually like making whole freezer meals ahead of time, but I do like preparing and freezing ingredients. It allows me to feel spontaneous and opens up lots of options while still saving me time. I have successfully done this with large amounts of rice, dry beans, bacon bits, bread, chicken stock, pan-fried chicken chunks, etc. (I have been planning to pre-dice and freeze onions, and even pre-caramelize some and freeze them in ice cube trays).

Now I am looking to make my chicken chunks from chicken leg quarters (the cheapest protein source after dried beans in my area, beating out protein powder, canned beans, eggs, and milk!). I want the chunks to have the browning and crispiness from pan frying, I don't want them to end up overcooked, and I don't want to debone them before starting (I would then consider my time more valuable than the difference in the chicken price and just buy boneless meat). So my thought is to parbake the chicken in the oven until I can pull the chicken off the bone with my hands, then cut into chunks and finish in the frying pan. Does anyone know at about what internal temperature I can expect the chicken to somewhat willingly separate from the bone? (If not, I'll probably just do it trial and error). If not one knows but there is interest in this technique, I'll comment here if/when I figure it out.",1,"Help me figure out the cheapest chicken chunks possible!I don't usually like making whole freezer meals ahead of time, but I do like preparing and freezing ingredients.

"I learned about an Italian 'peasant' dish called Riso al Forno...it's basically baked rice/risotto, and it's so good, pretty easy to make, and makes a ton so it's perfect for meal prep.","PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/E5Jrw3I.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/E5Jrw3I.jpg)

I don't know if this would interest anyone here, but I made lasagna last weekend, and I guess I thought I needed enough mozzarella for an army. I couldn't bear the thought of more lasagna so I started reading and I found out about *riso al forno*. There aren't a TON of recipes out there for it and a lot of them are in Italian, but I decided to give it a go. I don't think this is meant to have the super creamy consistency of risotto (I could be wrong; if anyone has any info on this dish, I'd love to be corrected!)

If you don't have arborio rice, I think you could still make something similar, just use 6 cups of cooked short-grain rice. 

The basic premise is you parboil arborio rice and toss it with oil and/or parmesan cheese. One recipe also suggested letting the rice cool down *completely* and then tossing it with 2 whisked eggs which is a great alternative to the cheese.

Then you basically layer it in a casserole dish... rice, homemade sauce, cheese, and then rice, sauce, cheese, and then bake for 25–30 minutes or until the rice is tender. You can use a mix of parmesan, provolone, or mozzarella or I bet you could even skip the cheese completely if you wanted to. 

It's basically like lasagna but with rice. I thought it turned out really good so I thought I'd share the recipe here.

I made a homemade meat sauce, but feel free to disregard that and just use \~6 cups of your favorite sauce. Marinara or a meat sauce would both be great in this.

Recipes I've seen online suggest that you could add cured meat to this or a layer of thinly sliced hardboiled eggs too.

### Ingredients

* 2 cups arborio rice
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 cup shredded parmesan cheese divided (or omit, it's not totally necessary)
* 1 teaspoon neutral oil
* 2 pounds ground meat of choice (beef, sausage, pork, turkey, or a mix)
* 2 tablespoons butter plus more for greasing the casserole dish
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more to taste
* ½ teaspoon dry thyme
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 3 15-ounce cans crushed tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon sugar optional
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese divided
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Parboil the arborio rice:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under very cold water. Once the rice is cool to the touch, transfer it to a large bowl with 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and toss to coat. Set aside.

#### Brown the meat:

* Add 1 teaspoon neutral oil to the second large pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the meat and use a wooden spoon to break them up as they cook—season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for 12–15 minutes until the meat browns and is mostly cooked through. Transfer to a bowl.

#### Cook the sauce aromatics:

* Melt the butter into the pot used to brown the meat. Once bubbly, add the onion and cook for 6–8 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic, crushed red pepper, and thyme and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Simmer the sauce:

* Add the tomato paste and mash it into the aromatics. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color. Add the canned tomatoes and stir to incorporate. Add the sugar, if you like. Add the cooked meat to the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking.

#### Assemble the rice:

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.
* Grease a 12×8 baking dish with butter.
* Add half of the parboiled arborio rice to the dish and use the back of your spoon to flatten it into an even layer. Next, ladle over half the sauce and spoon it into an even layer over the rice. Next, add half the shredded mozzarella cheese and half of the remaining grated parmesan (if using). Add the remaining rice and then the sauce. Finish the casserole with the remaining mozzarella and remaining parmesan cheese.

#### Bake the rice:

* Transfer to the preheated oven for 25–35 minutes. Check the rice at 25 minutes and continue baking until tender.

#### Broil the rice (optional):

* Once the rice is tender, drizzle with 1–2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil and transfer to the broiler for 1–2 minutes until the cheese bubbles and turns deep golden brown.

#### To serve:

* Allow the riso al forno to set out at room temperature for 5–10 minutes. Garnish with parsley, basil, or chili oil if you like.

Help with prepping my lunch breaks. Also open to suggestions.,"So I work delivery 5 days a week usually 9-10 hours a day. I have a decent sized lunch pale but no way to warm things up currently. 

 I used to make 2 ham/cheese sandwiches with mayo and mustard. I switched that up to 2 rolls with ham cheese onion bell pepper mayo and mustard.

What I'm trying to do if figure how to much to make it advance so I can have a tub of premixed cheese, onion, pepper, mayo, mustard. Then in the mornings, I simply pull out the tortillas and ham and add it in. Im concerned how much I can make it a batch without something going old. Could I possibly do 5 days in a single batch? 

Then I'm doing one big salad a day. I think it's tender reds and spinache? I'm tossing in chopped onions, small tomatoes, ranch or Italian vinaigrette depending on the day, and croutons.

Croutons and dressing are added at the time I eat. Again I would like to make a batch on Sundays and have it last all week. Is it going to be ""fresh"" enough by Friday? 

Then chopped carrots or celery bought in a big bag and cut those up Sundays and toss back in the bag. Easy peazy. 


How does all of it sound? Can I prep for a full week like this? Also do you have any suggestions of things I would want to try cooking for a week?

"Macaroni soup, with ham and whatever you like.","Honestly, this is such an underrated recipe that I feel is so slept on. I'm Asian American, so if you go to any Hong Kong style diners, you'll often find lots of breakfast items. Growing up I used to eat at a lot of these so-called ""cha cha tangs.""

One of my favorites is the macaroni soup, often with a chicken stock and some protein, like spam or ham. Much easier, tastier and cheaper to do at home then order from a diner.

Any pasta will work, but to remain classic, macaroni or elbows work best. You can use shells, ears, spaghetti whatever you like. Ideally, the pasta should be spoonable to your mouth. 

Cook pasta according to box directions, but add 3 or 4 minutes extra. You want it soft to the tooth. Add a bouillon cube or box chicken stock if you prefer to be fancy.

Add peas, carrots, corn or any other vegetables you have lying around. No need to drain and rinse, you want the pasta starch in your soup. Serve in bowls and add slice ham, spam, or no meat at all.

If you cook the whole box of pasta, you'll get enough to feed a whole family and then some, or cook just a quarter of the box for an easy weeknight meal. Takes as long as it does to boil the pasta and you have food on the table.

Cook pasta according to box directions, but add 3 or 4 minutes extra. You want it soft to the tooth. Add a bouillon cube or box chicken stock if you prefer to be fancy.

Add peas, carrots, corn or any other vegetables you have lying around. No need to drain and rinse, you want the pasta starch in your soup. Serve in bowls and add slice ham, spam, or no meat at all.

If you cook the whole box of pasta, you'll get enough to feed a whole family and then some, or cook just a quarter of the box for an easy weeknight meal. Takes as long as it does to boil the pasta and you have food on the table.

Pasta + chicken soup + vegetables."

What to do with a bunch of cookie crumbs,"I was so excited to see the Winternacht cookies back at Aldi.  I picked up a bag.  Opened it on Thanksgiving and most of the bag had been crushed.  So sad.

They are a spiced hard cookie.  I am going to make Sauerbraten for Christmas and these would make a good substitute for the ginger snaps in my recipe.  But its almost a whole bag of crumbs.  I only need about 1/2 cup.

Other than making a pie crust, any other ideas how to use these up?",1,"What to do with a bunch of cookie crumbsI was so excited to see the Winternacht cookies back at Aldi.  I picked up a bag.  Opened it on Thanksgiving and most of the bag had been crushed.  So sad.

Often overlooked; Pie pumpkins,"After thanksgiving, Pie pumpkins are reduced to 50cents each in my area. You don't have to use them for pie!!  One pumpkin is enough for 2-4 meals depending on your appetite and how many other things you mix with it, although I will say it is pretty dependent on having access to either an oven or stove. 

Great for soups, stuffed, or just chop it up and cook it on the stove to put on top of rice. The flavor is really light and super versatile, plus fairly filling and full of vitamins.

Not only do you get the pumpkin itself, but usually they'll have a decent amount of seeds inside which are good roasted or sprouted, or you could even try and save them for planting.",1,"Often overlooked; Pie pumpkinsAfter thanksgiving, Pie pumpkins are reduced to 50cents each in my area.

"When I have extra hummus, I use it to thicken my soups! This recipe for hummus and vegetable soup is so easy to make and really versatile depending on what you have on hand.","PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/vpKeQxf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vpKeQxf.jpg)

Recipe here originally: [Hummus and Vegetable Soup](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/easy-hummus-and-vegetable-soup/)

You can use any flavor, but I usually have a container of plain hummus on hand and I seem to always get through my carrots before I finish the hummus, so I throw it in soups to thicken them up.

This is a really easy recipe and it was so delicious! If you want to make it vegan, just omit the butter. 

Ingredient substitutions:

**Aromatics:** Celery, onion, carrots, or a blend.

**Veggies:** Mushrooms are a great choice because they can withstand a longer cooking time. You can also add crunchy green vegetables, like green beans, or leafy greens like escarole or spinach at the end of cooking.

**Pantry ingredients:** I used dry herbs: thyme and chili flakes. I also added a can of tomatoes, a can of chickpeas, and a cup of fusilli. You can use any bean or short pasta shape in this recipe. You could even try it with red or green lentils, but the cooking time will vary!

### Equipment

* Large pot

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 medium onion peeled and diced
* 8 ounces mushrooms trimmed and sliced
* 4 cloves garlic minced
* 2 tablespoons butter, optional
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon silk chili flakes or use 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 15-ounce can chickpeas drained
* 15-ounce can diced tomatoes
* 5 cups water or stock
* 1 cup dry fusilli
* ¼ cup plain hummus
* ¼ cup fresh parsley minced, plus more for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Cook the aromatics:

* Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 7–8 minutes, or it begins to brown around the edges. Season lightly with salt.

#### Cook the mushrooms:

* Add the mushrooms and cook for 10–12 minutes. Allow the mushrooms to release their liquid, and once the liquid evaporates, season with salt.

#### Bloom the herbs:

* Melt butter into the mushrooms. Once bubbly, add the minced garlic, thyme, and chili flakes. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Cook the soup:

* Add the chickpeas, tomatoes, and water or stock. Bring to a boil and add fusilli. Boil until the fusilli is al dente, adding more water as needed if too much cooks off—taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the soup:

* Stir in the hummus until completely incorporated into the broth. Add the parsley and cook an additional 2–3 minutes—taste and season once more to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

#### To serve:

* Divide the cooked soup between bowls and garnish with more parsley, if you like. Enjoy!",1,"When I have extra hummus, I use it to thicken my soups! This recipe for hummus and vegetable soup is so easy to make and really versatile depending on what you have on hand.PIC: [

I'm hesitant to waste the time and ingredients if I'm running the risk of my food not turning out properly, so I'm hoping you fine folks might have a workaround."

Caffeine is found in many beverages, including coffee, tea, energy drinks and colas, and in products containing cocoa or chocolate. It's also found in medications and dietary supplements, including supplements aimed at weight loss.

Although research about the connection between caffeine and weight isn't definitive, there are a few theories about how caffeine might affect weight, including:

Appetite suppression. Caffeine may reduce feelings of hunger and your desire to eat for a brief time.

Calorie burning. Caffeine appears to increase energy use even when you're at rest. It stimulates thermogenesis — one way your body generates heat and energy from digesting food.

Some studies looking at caffeine and weight were poor quality or done in animals, making the results questionable or hard to generalize to humans. Some studies found that decaffeinated coffee may contribute to modest weight loss, suggesting that substances or factors besides caffeine may play a role in weight loss.

The bottom line: Be cautious about using caffeine products to help with weight loss. When used in moderation (400 milligrams or less) by healthy adults, caffeine is generally safe. But too much caffeine might cause nervousness, insomnia, nausea, increased blood pressure and other problems.

Also keep in mind that some caffeinated beverages, such as specialty coffees or teas, are high in calories and fat. Just adding milk and sugar to coffee or tea could set back your weight loss efforts, especially if you drink multiple cups a day. Instead of losing weight, you might actually gain weight if you drink too many of these higher calorie drinks.

Orange Panna Cotta is creamy and fresh dessert, one of the best ideas you can make for your family! If you like easy no bake desserts, this recipe is for you. Beautiful dessert in a glass. It is a classic recipe for easy, rich and creamy Italian Panna Cotta. I make this every time when I need an impressive, quick dessert! Christmas is coming, this is one great option.

I am sure you know that Panna Cotta means ‘cooked cream’ in Italian. It includes very few ingredients, and is basically a simple mixture of cream, sugar, and a flavor of your choice. Gelatin is added to set the mixture and create a custard-like consistency. The final product is rich and silky smooth.

&amp;#x200B;

When ready it looks and tastes fancy! The fresh orange juice makes every creamy spoonful perfectly sweet and tangy. We love these mini desserts for parties! They are elegant and surprisingly simple. Panna Cotta can be made in advance so it is perfect for entertaining! Serve it in tiny shot glasses for a larger gathering (think: birthday parties , bridal shower, potluck, etc.).

Garnish with some mint, chocolate curls and fresh orange cubes on top. This keeps well for several days in the refrigerator

And then for a bag of 16oz dry black bean, not organic, it’s like $1.19. 

I ended up going with some cans of organic beans but would like some advice on the economics and then also if you have any take on if organic beans are necessary, let me know. Thanks."

Chicken or Pork Tacos🌮,"Firstly, yes i know pork is dark meat, but is a stable found in spanish dishes, tacos being one of em! TOO MUCH OF ANY FOOD IS UNHEALTHY. Moderation is key.

Anyways, boneless chicken breasts &amp; pork shoulder, are often a cheap meat that you can get ya bang for your buck aka a good amount of meat per pound. East Coast, US for $2-3/lb. 

The magic: A Crockpot. Use it if ya got it, HOWEVER, boiling the meat in water will do just fine. 

Before, ya start judging boiled meat🍖 thinking it'll be bland. SEASONINGS ARE YOUR FRIEND! 
Most broths that I come across (chicken, bone, etc) have alot of added salt so I'd steer clear of those if you have high blood pressure, but flavor the water with some seasonings of your choice like garlic, bell pepper, turmeric, Italian seasoning, etc. I find cinnamon &amp; citrus to pair best with dark meats, as found in various peking duck &amp; pork chop recipes.",1,"Chicken or Pork Tacos🌮Firstly, yes i know pork is dark meat, but is a stable found in spanish dishes, tacos being one of em!

Frozen spinach!,"I always have a bag of frozen spinach on hand. If you like the stuff, it is a great way to add nutrients to almost any dish. Have a soup and want some greens?

Suggestions for Low Acid GERD recipes!,"I (31M) work a very physical job, and my diet has always reflected that. I don't have a terribly *healthy* diet but I take steps where I can. More veggies, less soda, et cetera.

My girlfriend and I have been living together for a couple years, and due to her GERD (as well as a swallowing anxiety due to a traumatic experience a few years back) and other health issues (as well as a few of my own, ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression amongst them), coming up with safe recipes can be a hassle because I tend to default to what I used to cook. Pasta being the chief offender.

She's been drinking ACV tonics regularly, or as regularly as we can manage when her stomach isn't in rebellion, which helps her symptoms a good deal. (2tbsp ACV, 2tbsp honey, ginger, turmeric, a grind or two of pink salt, and a bit of cinnamon) But when it comes to food it's been difficult to come up with a stable diet when her trigger foods always seem to be such a crapshoot

What are good bases?,"I've been mealprepping recently more than I used to (when I was just eating leftovers). Every time I wonder what base I should opt for.

There usually is whole grain pasta, brown rice, potatoes, polenta as the ""healthy"" options and I do like all of them. As said: I wonder which one I should prefer over the others (not cutting out any of them). Which one is most satiating compared to nutrients and carbs?

I do know that in such cases you should opt for more veggies and less base but as I like to have a base WITH veggies and not just veggies... Lentils and beans are not that much a base for me but still find their place in my meals. Quinoa is fine as well but not every day.

I'm not trying to loose weight (I'm just 68kg / 1.68m) but to maintain it. Since I started thinking more about my eating I feel hungry a lot (am I eating less? Is it the thoughts? Or do I not allow me the amount of food I used to eat?) I went over to volume eating but don't get it: people eat kinda plain veggies and nothing else or substitute veggies for everything and thats not what I want. I really like veggies and fruits and usually have my five portions a day.

Boyfriend would like to only eat once a day (intermittent fasting) how to make meals surrounding this?,"My boyfriend would like to try intermittent fasting. He isn’t going to be strict about it because he works manual labor (he’ll eat if he feels lightheaded or anything, and he’ll still drink a smoothie with me every so often) but he would still like to try it out. 

he doesn’t need to lose weight, in fact he’s very fit. his main reasoning is how tired he gets after he eats, even if he eats low carb or generally less-heavy meals. it’s more of a mental thing I think. once he stops to eat, it’s difficult for him to start or restart his day. he has a lot more energy when he skips breakfast, so he would like to just eat one big meal a day and he done with it. 

I’ll need to fit in about 3.5k calories for the meal, and would love suggestions! preferably nutrient-dense. (so maybe mixed/wild rice instead of white, sweet potatoes instead of regular, that kind of thing) another thing I need to watch out for is nutrients. I’d like to make sure the meals are diverse enough to get any nutrients he needs on top of the calories. he takes supplements, but I’d love to have them in the cooking more than the pills. who likes swallowing them anyway? haha. 

so basically, a good balance between calories, nutrients, and size (because my main worry is him not being hungry enough in a time period to eat the calories and nutrients he needs) my meals are very different from his because I eat very lightly, so any help would be lovely! thank you! 

so far, my ideas are:

- blending a variety of vegetables into a smoothie for him to eat with his meal

- getting calories from nutrient-dense carbs like brown and wild rice

Have lots of bones and turkey carcasses? - Make congee/soup with them!,"One of my favorite reasons for the holidays is the amount of poultry we get. Eating this much bird ensures we have bones and carcasses lying around. People usually skip that part, but it's my favorite. The bones have so much flavor. Especially if they're roasted or cooked. Makes for an amazing bone broth soup if you boil it long enough, or stock for other items on your holiday list. Or one of my favorite ways to enjoy the large parts of bones with little meat, is to boil them with rice, in a porridge like fashion called congee or jook.   


A cup of rice and 8-9 cups of water will yield you almost 5-6 portions and bowls of congee. It's a simple, but hearty rice porridge. Once the rice starts boiling for about 10 or so minutes in, throw in all your bones and carcasses. The roasted-ness, as well as the bones, would impart all their flavor into the rice congee, and the meat will separate from the bones, falling into the congee. 

  
It's filling, warm, and low calories. Throw a fried egg on top, stir fry, or any little odds and ends from the fridge. I typically start with a blank canvas, but end up with a flavorful bowl of porridge.   


I typically have the congee and serve the items family-style, so I can appreciate each individual item, as opposed to having a mixed medley, although that's your preference.

What's your liquid of choice for smoothie base?,I like to use coconut water but it's expensive and expires quickly once opened.

Is it smart to buy a turkey AFTER thanksgiving?,"We’re trying to save money as much as possible, and I’m a fairly decent cook.

my manic manifesto on why everyone should eat curry,"this might have a kind of insane, frenzied energy to it, because somehow it took me years to realize that curry is literally *perfect* for everyone(mostly), and i desperately need to tell the world why this is in excruciating detail. on the way, you will learn a bit about me, and i about you. take my hand. let us begin.

a meal for me needs to be easy, because i have severe illnesses that make me very tired and depressed. i eat very little, and have a hard time getting myself to eat, so i'd say the food should be filling as well as healthy, and simple to prepare. less effort, less fatigue, more food, better health!! i had a field day at meijer in the world foods section, staring at all the flavors for ages and finally just grabbing 3 packets and a jar for butter chicken curry mmmm. that's $12.46, man. i was so excited, because maybe this meant i wouldn't be so hungry and weak. it was making me a bit emotional and excited lol.

another amazing thing about curry is the flavor. it is spicy, but many are mild and quite alright. if you have GI issues though, you might have trouble. not sure how spices affect that. there are so many interesting flavors and textures, and it's so easy to just grab half a dozen packets for super cheap and live off of that for the week, easy. all the flavor makes eating easier if you have a lack of appetite, too! and if you get tired of one, there are heaps of others. it's perfect for me.

that brings me to my last point. curry isn't just an exciting new idea to help my health, it's awesome for anyone. it's not just good for sick people, it's for busy people, or students, anyone strapped for cash, or even if you're just damn lazy and hate making food. it's also cool, because if you like cheaper curry, you'll probably love the really good shit. both taste good though, and are generally healthy, which is so cool to me. if you really get into it, you can eat premade stuff when you're low on time/energy, and have fun with the really [neat and interesting recipes](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/family-meals/slideshow/curry-recipes) when you have an evening.

30-Minute Weekday Bean Stew,"I wanted to share a quick, clean and vegan weekday bean recipe that I have adapted from [Budget Bytes's Quickie Black Eyed Peas and Greens](https://www.budgetbytes.com/quickie-black-eyed-peas-and-greens/). It takes a bit less than 30 minutes and has little prep time. 

Cooking beans from dry would be cheaper and more environmentally friendly but does require planning the day before or using an Instant Pot. This recipe uses canned beans so you can whip it up. 

This makes 5 servings. 

**Ingredients** 

* 1 yellow onion 
* 3 cloves garlic 
* 3 Tbsp olive oil 
* 1 large bell pepper (red or green) 
* 1 large stalk of celery 
* 3 15oz. cans black eyed peas or pinto beans or romano beans - all are tasty, feel free to grab whichever is cheapest. 
* 1 tsp dried oregano 
* 1 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 
* 1 bay leaf 
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper 
* 2 tsp Better than Bouillon (or bouillon)  
* 2 cups water
* 1 bunch of collard greens or kale 
* Hot sauce (to taste - I used some Carolina Reaper hot sauce I had around) 
* Rice. I used 1 cup of dry [parboiled brown rice](https://ca.bensoriginal.com/en-ca/products/wholegrain-brown-rice-20-minute-907g) or you can use white rice, if you're wanting to keep it under 30 minutes. Using normal brown rice will take about 40 mins. 

**Directions** 

1. Add olive oil to a large pot. While it is warming, chop onion, bell pepper, and celery. Dice garlic. 
2. Once oil is warm, add chopped onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic. Cook until onion is soft and translucent.  
3.  Drain beans or peas and add them to the pot with oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, pepper, bay leaf, water, and Better than Bouillon.  
4. Begin cooking rice. I use a 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water ratio for parboiled brown rice. 
5. Put lid on pot, turn heat up until it reaches a boil. While waiting for the beans to boil, rinse your greens and tear them off the stems. 
6. Once the beans are boiling, turn heat down to medium low. Add greens. You don't need to mix the greens in; they will steam on top. Simmer for 15 minutes. 
7. After the beans have simmered for 15 minutes, take lid off pot and mush some beans against the side of the pot to thicken the broth. Add salt if necessary - I did not need to add any, personally. Remove bay leaf. I added hot sauce post-serving so that it kept a good bite but you could also add hot sauce at this time.
8. Serve over rice.

Protein Pancakes,"I recently developed this recipe after some experimentation. The recipe makes two cakes, but can easily be scaled. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dry ingredients:

· ¼ c flour

· ½ tsp baking powder

· 1 scoop (25g protein) protein powder

· Pinch salt

· 1 tsp granulated sweetener

&amp;#x200B;

Wet ingredients:

· 2/3 c water, roughly

· 2 tsp oil

&amp;#x200B;

Mix the dry ingredients together, add wet, mix until most lumps are gone. After that you’re just making pancakes. 

I omitted egg from the recipe because I found protein powder works as a good binding agent. The protein powder I used (Truetein) also contained egg white protein. I am not sure how the recipe tastes with other powders, but with Truetein it is a treat.

Note that this much protein powder will make the pancakes a little gummy. They are still delicious, but a more traditional pancake can be made by halving the amount of protein powder (or my preferred method, doubling the other ingredients).

Food banks for those not struggling,"Hi, I recently had an interesting idea when I came across the statistic that foodbanks can get $5 worth of value from a $1 donation. I'm not sure how true that is, but it made me think. I can afford groceries, definitely- I'm not affluent but I'm fine. However, I'm wondering if couldn't take the opportunity to use the food bank, calculate it's value at a regular store and pay maybe 1/2 to 2/3 the value back to the food bank as a donation.  


Basically I'd be able to save money on groceries and donate part of that excess back to the foodbank- to me it seems like a win/win, but I need to know that I'm not overlooking something here.

Cooking or not cooking is a state of mind.

A state of mind is the result of a framework of thinking, usually transmitted culturally,

that leads to repetitive mental and physical action lifestyle.

If the culture you grew up in conditioned you to think that you cannot cook, or that you do not have time to cook, well, then here is the first recipe:

Develop a new framework of thinking.

The new way of cooking arises from that organically.

Cooking with only a little time to spare, with short resources?  You are in luck.

Other than the phone in your pocket and few other developments, our modern schedule is not much different than that of a medieval peasant, and that style has been done before to perfection.  Especially in the kitchen.

The secret is to shift time.   

Your personal time, in this era, comes in short burst intervals.

Instead of eating as you run out the door, consider cooking on the way out.

Consider that you have 48+ hours to prepare a meal in short interval bursts which address several micro-projects, each needing only a few seconds of daily attention.

For instance, an ongoing countertop / refrigerator type bread dough, might take an hour overall, but that hour is also in short burst intervals.   When you look at it on an instructional video, well, that’s as misleading as a book.  It’s not a chapter of complexity, just a simple handful of flour (your handful and pinch is a specific repeatable measure, that will lead to your personal signature in cooking -with lot’s less expense and dishwashing).  Now a stir of water with a chopstick.  Once you have your stage and rhythm it takes about 15 seconds.  Really.  Do this for several days and then one magical night when you make it back, simply pour the ‘bread batter’ into a heavy pan, do something fun time for the rise and then bake the bread in a pool of olive oil and sea salt.   Eat this loaf for the next days and continue to nourish your yeast empire.  You can do this in a ziplock next to your skin if needed, then bake it in a beer can.

Stir, pour, and bake.  It’s a mantra about time and relationship.

This way of thinking benefits all but the most royal ways of cooking, and leads to an easy ongoing harvest throughout the week.  Many times we are recommended to spend our weekends building a loaded freezer, but this swiftly becomes oppressive and regimented, the food tastes rushed because flavors we cherish generally develop over days not minutes.   Humans cooking can be more of a dance that enriches you and the ones you love, ever growing forward.  The food will nourish you physically, the act of cooking will nourish you emotionally.

If you are seriously short on time get a simple (easy to clean) single blade/bowl food processor and one of them instapot things.  A blender, the best you can get, cheap pans from the thrifts.  (I’m stuck on cast iron &lt;and the secret to cast iron is to simply use it every time you cook and don’t wash it, rather scrape out the particles with a Japanese style Tawashi coconut dish brush and hot tap water…..quick so you don’t remove the bottom layer of oil on the pan.  Nothing will grow on a frequently heated pan except for the rich seasoned patina every one seems to want for their irons.  This cast iron maintenance really takes about 15 seconds depending how far your sink is from your stove.

And if you don’t have a kitchen, well, you can grow gardens in your pockets….I've sprouted seeds and beans, a handful in a heavy reusable ziplock….you can soak, rinse and sprout using your body heat in an inside pocket.  I have done this in Alaska.  Try a handful of bean sprouts next time you need a lift.  Some of the best nutrition you can get can travel with you as an ongoing living relationship thing.

Expect an adventurous first month or so as you push through the necessary fears and failures of learning new things.  But in this case what you gain is more than a box of scribbled instructions.

This dance is inside of you already, and will nourish you and the ones you love for life.

Ideas for low sodium and low simple sugar snacks?,"Hey there!

I have a condition called Meniere's, and while my overall diet is pretty much okay considering the recommendations and such, I'm struggling with finding snacks that would be okay for consumption as most of the time, it's either too high in sodium or sugar.

Overall, my doc have advised to try sticking with the migraine regimen if possible (essentially, avoiding stuff: with preservatives; processed food with high monosodium glutamate content; fermented products, such as cheeses; chocolate (due to caffeine, so teas and coffee is out as well); nuts; egg white; fresh breads and yeast products; aged/processed meats; beans and fruits that have high histamine/tyramine content; and pickled or preserved fruits/vegetables).

Sugar is okay in moderate quantities, but it's best to avoid as it can cause insulin spikes leading to reabsorbing more sodium and so on.

My oatmeal recipe is 1 cup oatmeal to 1 cup soy milk and 2 cups of water(weight gain diet).
When I put it for 8 min on high it's still not ready.

That's over half an hour just to make the damn thing and then having to wait forever for it to cool down
Adding less liquid doesn't help, it just dries up and stays gritty. And in comparison with the quacker brand it takes about 16 min of microwaving which is still ridiculous.

Do I eat them straight out of the can or do I still need to cook them? I just want them to be a major source of carbs like rice. So do I eat them plain? Also, can I eat them everyday?

I am planning on cooking for six (men's recovery group home) this upcoming Thanksgiving day. I unfortunately only have about $60 to work with and it's unanimous that no one here wants turkey.

What basic things can I prepare for six men for $60? An entree and any number of sides, even if only one side dish?

I have a basic kitchen (stove/oven, microwave oven and a crock pot) to work with.

The only restrictions? No potatoes or pumpkin. Several people here (myself included) have very strict medical dietary restrictions.

Thank you for any ideas!",1,"Looking for some cheap Thanksgiving dinner ideasHowdy.

"I have a MASSIVE turkey I got for free and i don't plan on making a thanksgiving dinner, what are some ways to make it last?","Not sure of the weight, but its butterball and thawing in the fridge currently. 

All I can really think to do with it is thaw it, cut it in to pieces, refreeze, and use the bones for stock. 

Neither me or my partner aren't big fans of turkey, but we do use ground turkey instead of ground beef in most things cause its cheaper. Sadly i don't have a grinder or a stand mixer so i can't make my own.  


What are some way's we can use it afterwards? whatever you would use chicken in? I feel like Turkey Tikka Masala or pulled turkey burritos would be really weird......

Vegetable Pizza. Good way to get your daily/weekly vegetable Intake? am I cheating too much?,"Hello Everyone. 

Im just coming to terms that I need to eat more vegetables. 

I eat none at the moment and after moving out my my parents home and living by myself for the first time my diet is plummeting

My diet consists of steak/pasta/rice/eggs/ with some form of proteins mixed in

I went to the grocery store and got a bunch of vegetables that are tollerable for me.

- Mushrooms
- Red/Green Capsicums
- Zuchini's
- Brocolli

Two large vegetable pizza's a week will get me through 3 or 4 meals and ill add some proteins on the side that I normally eat. Wether it be steak/sausages/chicken 

I feel like I would eat a pizza with these toppings mixed with some cheese. 

Am I deluding myself that this is healthy? I dont see myself eating ""roast"" vegetable or steaming them as thats plain and boring.

Under $50 meal plans + tips. Hope it helps someone,"I don't know if this helps anyone but I hope it does.  I've been through lean times and good times.  I've had to cook chopped kitchen stlye more times than I like to admit and I currently feed my family of 9 breakfast lunch and dinner ever day.  We are in a good place now but early on I had to teach myself had to cook everything from scratch on very little.



I put together 3 lists (breakfast lunch and dinner) with ingredients, prices and basic instructions for 5 days.  I hope it helps someone.



They aren't fancy.  They aren't 5 star and there are definitely ways to make it tastier.They are just super simple ,bare bones cooking for those oh crap weeks when you have little to no money.



I also included a tips section at the end for how I make things cheaper in every day cooking. 




Under $50 menu plans-

I put the cost of just the dinners and then  listed Breakfasts and lunches  last because many get breakfast or lunch provided at school and sometimes work.

The plans are-

-Cooking for just you or 2
-Small family plan with meat.

If you have a large family like I do, double the small family plans.


All prices are from the Walmart app (Nov 21, South Louisiana).  Your prices may vary.


After each I included a few nice extras that would make things tastier if you have the money.

I did not add in the cost of salt and pepper because most people have these or can get them easily enough.

Tips to pad out meals 

*always shop sales for produce.   Buy what's on sale and serve it raw in salads or simply sauteed.
*potatoes and rice go a long way and are almost always cheap. Mashed potatoes, roast potatoes, 
Baked potato wedges, mexi rice, buttered rice, rice pilaf, rice pudding....the lists goes on. You get the idea.
*Learn a great bread recipe.  Overnight bread is a good one. Make bread for dinner and learn to add in different combos of seasoning and herbs or cheese 
*add in Frozen vegetables for bulk and nutrition.  They are cheap and easy to have on hand.
*use the flipp app to see sales and compare before you go out 
*save your potato peels and veggie scraps.  Freeze them in a big zip lock until full then make veggie broth sorry a soup, gravy, or to add in anything
*make a kitchen sink soup at the end of the week to use up Leftovers 
*shop ethnic markets for cheaper produce
*freeze your greens if they start to turn.   Same with Bananas.  When you are ready add them to smoothies.",1,"Under $50 meal plans + tips.

Tips to pad out meals 

*always shop sales for produce.   Buy what's on sale and serve it raw in salads or simply sauteed.
*potatoes and rice go a long way and are almost always cheap. Mashed potatoes, roast potatoes, 
Baked potato wedges, mexi rice, buttered rice, rice pilaf, rice pudding....the lists goes on. You get the idea.
*Learn a great bread recipe.  Overnight bread is a good one. Make bread for dinner and learn to add in different combos of seasoning and herbs or cheese 
*add in Frozen vegetables for bulk and nutrition.  They are cheap and easy to have on hand.
*use the flipp app to see sales and compare before you go out 
*save your potato peels and veggie scraps.  Freeze them in a big zip lock until full then make veggie broth sorry a soup, gravy, or to add in anything
*make a kitchen sink soup at the end of the week to use up Leftovers 
*shop ethnic markets for cheaper produce
*freeze your greens if they start to turn.   Same with Bananas.  When you are ready add them to smoothies."

Best one-person blender for smoothies in late 2021?,"Let me preface this by saying that I have done a lot of research, watched numerous videos comparing various blenders, from the basic nutribullet, to the entire line of vitamix blenders (starting at the ONE all the way up to a3500), and almost everything in between.

While most people agree that you can't go wrong with the vitamix, I'm thinking that it might not be the optimal blender for ME and my circumstances. So I'm asking for your advice.

1) I don't care about the longevity of the device. While 10 year warranties for vitamix are great, I don't expect to stay in the US for more than a few years at most, and won't be lugging a blender back with me. So a 2-3 year usability lifespan is totally ok for me.

2) I live alone. I don't actually need 64 oz containers, and think they might actually be worse for smoothies. My smoothies usually range from 20 to 26 oz. So too small containers are disqualified, and too big containers are a negative.

3) What I do value, though, is that there are no chunks or chewies in the smoothie. I used to have a 300w generic blender back home and it had issues with leafy greens and some other ingredients.

4) Also super important - a self-clean function. I would make smoothies almost every day, so if I can fill the container with warm water and put some dish soap to clean it, instead of putting it in the dishwasher, that's a huge plus!

**tl;dr** I'm looking for a blender for one person, who will be using it for smoothies from 20 to 26 oz in size, and ""smoothness"" is super important to me, as well as the ability to self-clean, while to durability of the device isn't.

"How can I keep my hair long if it's frizzy, dry, damaged?"," **How can I keep my hair long if it's frizzy, dry, damaged?**

The best first step you can take is to determine why your hair is frizzy, dry and damaged in the first place.

* What is your natural hair type, texture and dominent cuticle shape?
* Is your hair thin, fine, very fine, medium, thick or very thick?
* Do you have naturally straight, wavy, curly or oily hair or a combination?
* Is your hair naturally dry to very dry or is it due to a long history of chemical processing (bleach, hair color, chemical straightening, relaxing or curling)?

**After You’ve Done A Very Honest Assessment**

Once you’ve done an honest assessment of your natural hair type, texture and cuticle shape, you can determine what cause of your frizz, dryness, and damage.

Then you can take steps to reverse the damage and move forward with healthy long hair.

If your hair is naturally textured such as wavy and curly, it can easily lose moisture due to the shape of the hair.

It’s critical to use the proper wet and dry washing procedures along with the proper cleansing tools.

If your hair is dry to very dry because of your natural hair type, that can also be addressed.

Finally, if your hair is damaged from chemical processing, you will need to address that and make the appropriate changes.

**Find A Professional Who Can Help You**

The best thing you can do for yourself is to find a professional hairstylist who specializes in either textured (naturally wavy, curly or coily) or long hair.

Make an appointment for a paid consultation of your hair and a list of possible recommendations.

Even though may stylists will offer or provide a no charge consultation, they will then pressure you to have services (cut, color, conditioning or similar).

**Consider Paying For A Wash And Dry**

If you insist on paying for a consultation, the stylist won’t feel the need to pressure you to have services performed which they might do if you accept a free consultation.

If they won’t allow you to have a free consultation, ask to pay for a shampoo and blow dry and then discuss your goals.

Ground meat differences and ideas,"When I go to the super market, I buy ground meat for burgers.

Because I am an athlete with IBS and gastric reflux, I avoid fat, so pork is out of the equation...

But seeing the difference in price, I have started to have second thoughts. So I would like your help here:

First of all, is ground pork good? I mean, is it way fattier than beef? 

Also, does it smell? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I've heard that patties from pork need more seasoning to cover the smell. Now, I can't have many spices, so I am restricted to oregano, spearmint and salt. Also, I keep them pretty clean, adding only quaker additionally.

Is the caloric difference that big? I watch my diet, and even though I don't have weight or health issues, I don't want to have in the future..!

Please, I would appreciate your help..!

I got sick of wasting half cans of tomato paste...now I make tomato broth!,"Any time I make tomato sauce, I use a tablespoon from the can (or the squirt tube) and then I chuck it in the fridge and then inevitably forget about it.

I started making tomato broth with the leftover paste and end up with a super easy kinda-sorta soup that is perfect for meal prep and only has a few ingredients. I almost always have something on hand that I can chuck in there. I usually do pasta and beans and if I have a leafy green like spinach or escarole, I throw that in too.

Here's how you make it:

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 onion, peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons butter, optional
* A few shakes of spices such as crushed red pepper, smoked paprika, dry thyme, or garlic powder
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 4–5 cups water or stock
* Pinch of sugar
* 1 cup dry short pasta (rotini, fusilli, orzo, etc)
* 15-ounce can of white beans, drained
* Optional: A handful of spinach or arugula

Method:

1. Heat oil in a large pot. Add the onion and cook until golden brown. 
2. If using, melt the butter into the onion. Once bubbly, add your choice of spices. I used crushed red pepper and garlic powder. Probably about 3/4 tsp crushed red pepper and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Cook 30 seconds.
3. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the onion. Cook 2 minutes until it's fragrant.
4. Pour in water. Add the sugar and bring to a boil.
5. Add the pasta and white beans and reduce heat to medium. Cook until al dente, about 10-15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
6. If using, stir in some greens like spinach or arugula.

"Hey Reddit, Help a 13 year old not eat her way into my 300lb life: European Edition","I have 2 very bad habits when it comes to food: I like to eat horribly and i like to eat too much. 

I go to school where I pack an unhealthy, quick packed lunch that I take with me and 2 friends who show their affection with food waiting for me there. I come back home and pour bowls of junk down my gob as a snack. I'm also currently trying to stop developing an impulse control issue around food. I'm 7 kilos up from what was already a very comfortable weight and I'm trying to get back there.

I just need a few low cal and teen-friendly and preferably quick lunch meals to start off with. Something it doesn't matter if I eat a little too much of because it isn't calorie dense. Has anyone got any?

Grab canned pumpkin on sale and use it to cut jarred sauces. Good way to cut the sodium and sneak your family more vegetables,"In the USA it's usually on sale after Thanksgiving. That being said, unless you live in a place where pumpkin is incredibly cheap and a jar of marina is oddly expensive, this probably won't save you much money. But adding like, 1 part pumpkin to 3-4 parts sauce seems to slip under the radar of picky kids and immediately adds bulk and vitamins. You can also add it to soup, chili, and rice dishes. Just make sure you get the canned 100% pumpkin and not the ""pumpkin pie filling""!

To store, I do the classic ice-cube-tray thing so I always have a few frozen cubes I can toss into whatever.",1,"Grab canned pumpkin on sale and use it to cut jarred sauces.

"My ""fake peanut butter cheesecake"" dip/spread - ridiculously easy, and SO tasty","I hope snack posts are okay here! This is pretty indulgent, but tastes way worse for you than it actually is. (Still calorie dense tho, so be careful. :) )

I discovered this combo by accident, and now I can't stop eating it lol. It's stupidly easy and SO tasty. The flavor reminds me of peanut butter cheesecake, hence why I'm calling it my ""fake peanut butter cheesecake"" dip/spread/snack!

* Plain Greek yogurt
* Peanut butter (I use creamy unsweetened PB)
* Honey to taste (you could probably use maple syrup, agave syrup, or even just sugar tbh)

I use slightly more yogurt than PB as otherwise it can get thick and tiresome to mix. Mix the yogurt and PB thoroughly until it's a solid color and texture. Then I mix in honey until I reach my desired level of sweetness. I like to make big bowls of this to snack on over the course of the week. It keeps perfectly fine in the fridge in a covered bowl.

I like to eat it with celery sticks. Or apples. Or on toast. Or just straight out of the bowl with a spoon. But this + celery has become a pretty decent breakfast for me, as carb-heavy breakfasts give me pretty bad reactive hypoglycemia while this gives me zero issues. Good fats, fiber, protein, and keeps me full for a long while after just a few celery sticks dipped in this goodness.

Healthy-wise, for how ""indulgent"" this tastes, I think the ingredients are pretty ""wholesome"", if fat and calorie dense (damn peanut butter!). So definitely don't eat a whole bowl of this in one sitting if you're counting cals. :)

Pricewise it's only as expensive as the three ingredients. YMMV but for me, it's peanuts. Pun intended.

I'm also curious how this would work with vegan yogurt alternatives.

PS: plain Greek yogurt is awesome. Mixing it with hot sauce for a guilt-free creamy buffalo dip is also really yummy.",1,"My ""fake peanut butter cheesecake"" dip/spread - ridiculously easy, and SO tastyI hope snack posts are okay here!

Satisfying late night eats?,"Between working late and being able to go out to events at night I’ve noticed I have been eating a lot of fast food.

Once I get out of work or the activity I have tended not to eat dinner and then it seems like everything nearby is closed except for fast food drive thrus. 

Tonight I got out of an event and ate fast food and am left feeling slightly nauseated and sad.

I don’t tend to eat “healthy” late at night so anything that’s healthier than fast food is a good suggestion for me. Food just hits different at night and I tend to crave things I really shouldn’t eat like salty, fatty etc. I’m looking for things that aren’t too healthy (like no kale salad or anything, I love that for lunch but no way after 10pm) but will hit the spot and keep me out of the fast food line.",1,"Satisfying late night eats?Between working late and being able to go out to events at night I’ve noticed I have been eating a lot of fast food.

Beginner to cooking/shopping wondering what cooking oils to use.,"Hello! I'm new to cooking and loving learning more and more all the time!

I'm literally at the novice level where I was shopping for cooking oil and I bought a big thing of vegetable oil to use (mostly stir frys, meatless meats that don't have fat in them, stuff like that for now) because it said ""vegetables"" on the front, and I assumed it was healthier. Apparently it's the least healthy one! (except for butter?)

I also saw cooking spray being used and thought that was cool, so I bought two cans of spray canola oil, but that might not be as healthy as I thought? even though the bottle says no fat?

Should I buy a spray bottle thing to put oil in so that less goes farther?

My favourite seasoning (delicious and no extra calories) - Tajin,"I'm from the UK and most people here have never tried or heard of Tajin, but everyone I know who has tried it has loved it. For those who don't know, it's a seasoning mix made from dried chilli, lime and salt, and nothing nasty or artificial in it. It adds so much flavour and really lifts up a dish. I use it on all sorts of healthy food like:

Fish, especially salmon. Baked in the oven with a sprinkling of Tajin on it halfway through (too much exposure to heat can take away the lime flavour I have found).

Chicken. I marinate my wings with Tajin and hot sauce, and everyone loves them. It also makes chicken breast much more exciting.

Baked vegetables. Courgettes, peppers, onions and carrots all go really well with it. Also, steamed veg like tenderstem broccoli or cauliflower with garlic and Tajin is an amazing healthy side dish.

Fruit. Tajin is actually marketed as a fruit seasoning, and it is delicious on slices of practically any fruit you can think of. Also, slices of cucumber with Tajin make for a delicious snack too.

I buy mine on amazon for about 10$ and it lasts months.",1,"My favourite seasoning (delicious and no extra calories) - TajinI'm from the UK and most people here have never tried or heard of Tajin, but everyone I know who has tried it has loved it.

He is allowed to have most meats, pasta, creamy soups, white rice, white bread, tortillas, canned fruits, dairy. He can eat some vegetables like carrots as long as they are cooked to be extremely soft. Basically if it is smooth and digests well and doesn't contain much more than 2 g of fiber per serving.
