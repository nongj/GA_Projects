    "Once again, we reload the relevant libraries and import the engineered dataset from Part 2. At this juncture, it would be prudent to remind ourselves of the problem statement and model framework. As the appointed data scientist for Ames City Council's Planning Division, the task is to develop a regression-based model to predict the sale prices of houses in Ames, Iowa. The intended end-users are primarily the Ames population and prospective individual(s) considering to relocate to Ames. The production model will be built upon a three-prong framework which strives for accuracy (optimized bias), applicability (optimized variance) and accessibility. For accuracy and applicability, the threshold set is a maximum degradation rate of 15% on both R2-scores and RMSE. In terms of accessibility, this was largely already achieved in Part 2.2 (Data Visualization & Feature Engineering) and will be revisited in the concluding section. \n"

This metric shows the degree of deviation between predicted and target values. \n",

    "The coefficients across all four models are relatively comparable, indicating that effect of each respective predictor feature on the target variable (house sale price) is relatively consistent as well and signalling to effective feature selection and engineering. Hence, all four models are likely to be stable.  \n",

    "Zooming in on the five identified factors with heaviest influence on housing prices in Ames, these predictors roughly corresponds with our findings stated in Part 2 summary previously and are generally sensible traits which home buyers across the world look out for when purchasing a property, except for below-grade area which is limited to landed houses. Almost naturally, Above-grade area takes precedence amongst all other features since it is the best indicator of livable space, a fundamental imperative. This is followed very closely by Overall quality, which alludes to the importance of attaining an equilibrium between quantity (represented by Above-grade space) and quality (represented by Overall quality).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, Below-grade area ranks highly in this regard too. Personally, living in a high intensity country which prioritizes building upwards rather than downwards, it was difficult to resonate with this point. Hence, we turn our heads to this [*reddit commentary*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/fycqk8/are_basements_common_in_houses_in_the_us/) to unearth (no pun intended) opinions on the value (or lack thereof) of basement in US. In sum, it is common and arguably even a necessity for houses located in the northern states to have basements as foundations have to be built below the frost line to ensure structural integrity. Traditionally, basements doubled-up as storage spaces, especially given the different equipments/furnitures used arising from seasonal variation. Also, the geology (softer rocks) for northern US states are more conducive for excavation/earthworks. Conversely, states towards the south almost entirely have no basements given frequent flooding incidences. In the context of Ames, the diurnal monthly temperature has a summer-high and winter alow is about 30 degrees-celcius and -10 degrees-celcius respectively [*source*](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/), explaining the high occurences of houses with basements. Interesting, an [*article*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-the-man-cave-took-over-americas-basements) also surfaces an increasing prevalence of the 'man cave' phenomenon, where basements are repurposed as semi-living recreational spaces geared towards men; the underground nature of basements emits \"chill\" vibes which creates an optimal environment for the 'man cave'. \n",

    "Where Neighbourhood is concerned, we expand the spatial scale beyond that of the house per se to consider the surroundings. Naturally, the immediate vicinity is a critical consideration for both practical (access to daily necessities; quantum of communal, sports & recreational and educational facilities etc.) and personal (relations with direct neighbours; ability to assimilate into community etc.) reasons. Age is often considered too as a reflection of condition, assuming a miminal level of wear-and-tear over time. Hence, it shares an inverse relation with housing prices. On this note, it was interesting to note that Overall quality had such a large influence on housing prices while Overall condition was somewhat negligible, signalling to home buyers prioritizing quality over condition. A possible reason might be that it is cheaper to maintain/repair a high-quality house (i.e. improve condition) as compared to purchasing high-quality replacement equipments and furniture (i.e. improve quality).  \n",
    "\n",
    "On a closing note, it is compelling to note that Kitchen quality, Fireplace, Total outdoor area and Paved driveway score relatively high. Living in a fast-paced society with hectic lifestyle, kitchens are often reduced to nothing more than functional spaces while fireplace, outdoor areas and paved driveways foreign concepts given the climate and public housing model. This goes back to an earlier point raised that *context matters*: these features are pertinent in the context of suburban houses in US (such as the case of Ames); they contribute to the \"American dream\" and 'utopic suburbia fantasy' [*(source)*](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-suburbs-from-american-dream-to-bland-2020-8), though critiques have asserted a paradigmatic shift in the suburbia ideology over the past decade.  \n",

    "Comparing the R2 and RMSE scores, it is consistent values for the respective scores across the models suggest that the models are reasonably stable resulting from a good selection/engineering of predictor features. **Since heaviest weightage is accorded to Test RMSE score, we will adopt Enet regression for the production model as it has the lowest Test RMSE score.** This is on the basis that a lower test RMSE score likely translating to better predictability on a completely new dataset (i.e. lower variance), as the absolute difference between actual and predicted housing price is minimized. Further, the close R2 scores alludes to an optimal bias-variance tradeoff. The reasonably low alpha values for ridge, lasso and elastic net models is indicative of only a small penalty being applied to the variable coefficients; this may be construed positively as it means that an ideal number and type of predictor features were selected. \n"

There is a slight decrease observed in R2 and RMSE scores for the full train dataset when applying the production model, but still acceptable on a whole as the decrease is only marginal. The consistently average R2 score of about 0.9 is well within the established parameter for accuracy in 1.1.3 (The Data Science Problem - Model Framework), which allows for a minimum R2 score of 0.85 based on a maximum degradation rate of 15%. As such, the model has achieved it's first goal of being *accurate*."

Applying the maxiumum allowable degradation rate of 15% established in 1.1.3 (The Data Science Problem - Model Framework), the permissible RMSE is USD181,469 x 0.15 = USD27,220.

    "- Hedonic Pricing Method: From the project's onset in Part 1.1.4 (The Data Science Problem - Additional Research), the conceptual foundation for the eventual production model was laid by asserting that houses prices are based on a hedonic pricing method, thereby providing the economic justification in adopting regression techniques for the production model. Granted that this is largely true as elucidated by the project's findings (i.e. house prices are strongly correlated to selected variables such as living area, overall quality and age), there will always be a handful of observations which do not conform to a hedonic pricing method. This is best exemplified by the presence of outliers, which any model - regardless of the refinement cycles underwent - will not be able to predict.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Target Variable Applicability: Under Part 1.2.2 (EDA - Examine Target Variable (Sale Price)), the effect of the US subprime mortgage crisis was acknowledged, especially its influence on dwindling housing sale prices from 2007 to 2010. In other words, the production model was built upon using a curated set of features to predict Ames housing prices of perculiar time period. Therefore, the model must be cautiously applied in other temporal context as the housing sale prices over subject time period are likely to be artificially deflated and hence, its applicability compromised. \n"

    "Returning to the problem statement, the envisioned goal was to construct a regression-based model guided by the triple-A framework to predict Ames housing sale prices, with the Ames population as well as invidiuals/families considering to migrate to Ames as the targetted end-users. To this end, the production model has achieved the objectives set; not only are the benchmarks for *accuracy* and *applicability* met, but the production model managed to break the predictor features down into easily *accessible* categories. While the threshold levels for accuracy and applicability (max. 15% degradation) might not be adequately stringent for the likes of property investors, the model serves its primary purpose of providing an indicative estimated selling price of a given house in Ames for buyer's consideration, where a higher degree of flexibility is accorded. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap: geographical and internal built environment factors seemingly have the largest influence on housing prices in Ames, followed closely by external built environment factors. On the contrary, parcellation and miscellaneous factors pale in comparison, except where the age of the house is concerned. In particular, the factors which influence housing prices the most are Above-grade area, Overall quality, Below-grade area, Neighbourhood and Age. For reference, the table above shows the change in housing sale price for every unit change in the accompanying predictor variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, having successfully developed the production model, the Planning Division may liaise with the relevant Ames City Council departments (e.g. IT Division) in creating an end-product for consumers. This includes integrating the production model with the interface on [*Beacon*](https://beacon.schneidercorp.com/Default.aspx) - where users can identify subject houses by keying in the Parcel ID, to create a map/geospatial app for end-users. The process of purchasing a house is afterall, an inherently spatial process. \n"

    "Although the project has achieved the main objective set of developing a robust model to predict housing sale prices on a framework grounded in *accuracy*, *applicability* and *accessibility*, there is still scope to improve the production model in these aspects:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Additional Model Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as care was taken in cleaning, selecting and engineering features to ensure a comprehensive yet not overfitted production model, this was done manually for most parts. Hence, the model is constrained by human limitations. An immediate measure to enhance the model as part of tuning would be implementing computer functions (e.g. SelectKBest, GridSearchCV, GradientBoostingRegressor), which not only reduces effort and time expanded but will likely produce a better outcome in terms of model optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Economic Conditions  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the onset, emphasis has been placed on the influence of external economic conditions on housing sale prices in US. In the context of this project, the data collection time period coinciding the US subprime mortgage crisis resulted in recorded housing sale prices affected by external economic conditions. Additional predictor features in the form of economic indicators (e.g. GDP by state, income per capita) may be included in the model to dampen the effects of economic swings on US housing sale prices. In doing so, the model's variance is improved and by extension, applicability across different time scales/periods.  \n",

    "    c) Prevailing Government Policies  \n",
    "    \n",
    "The role of politics has largely been disregard thus far. Speaking from personal/professional experience with regards to the build environment industry, changes in government policies often trigger a swift response from developers. Thus, future models may consider incorporating features relating to [*Ames' Building Codes*](https://www.cityofames.org/government/departments-divisions-i-z/inspections/building-permits/building-codes), which plays a significant role in shaping the built environment/form and resultantly, the sale price of the subject house. \n"

    "As the project draws to a close, in the capacity of both a local home buyer and urban planner, I contemplate on the lessons which could be extended to Singapore's context. A housing sale price model in the same mold may be developed for Singapore's public housing model (i.e. HDB); besides the handful of universally applicable predictor variables (e.g. Overall quality, Neighbourhood, Age), context-specific features to consider including are distance to MRT stations, and dwelling unit orientation relative to the west \"afternoon\" sun (heat) and major roads (noise), among others. Apart from Residential developments, another idea worth exploring is a property sale price predictor model for other development types (e.g. Commercial, Industrial), which would indisputably be valued by real estate investors and industry players alike. \n"
