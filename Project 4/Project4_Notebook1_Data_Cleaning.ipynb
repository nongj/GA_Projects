    "It would be a truism to state that Covid-19 has thrown the world into a state of disarray, with 'pandemic' being the buzz-word of the decade. Doubtless, the ongoing pandemic demonstrates the importance of disease prevention, mitigation and response in preventing disruptions. At present, the disease in question is the West Nile Virus, which has been rampant in the United States since the turn of the century ([*source*](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/index.html)). \n"

    "As advised by the [*Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)*](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html#:~:text=West%20Nile%20virus%20(WNV)%20is,summer%20and%20continues%20through%20fall.), the West Nile Virus (hereafter \"WNV\") is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in continental US. Although birds serve as the virus host, the WNV is transmitted to humans via female mosquitoes which become carriers through biting infected bird species ([*source*](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/west-nile-virus)). There are no vaccines to  or medications to treat WNV, although most people who caught WNV do not fall sick and only about 1 in 5 people develop symptoms (e.g. fever, headache, bodyache,  joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash). The WNV was first detected in 1937, in the West Nile District of Uganda. Hitherto, the virus has proliferated throughout multiple continents, including Africa, Asia, Australia, South America and North America ([*source*](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/facts#:~:text=WNV%20was%20first%20isolated%20in,%2C%20Europe%2C%20Asia%20and%20Oceania.)). As seen in Fig. 1 above, almost the whole of US in entirety is affected by WNV, with states in the (mid)west regions (i.e. Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota) experiencing the highest frequencies of WNV rates. \n"

    "For the intents of this study, we zoom in on Chicago, the 'windy city' located on the northeastern periphery of Illinois. Chicago is the third largest US city by population (~2.7million) and coupled with being one of the most expansive US metropolitans, Chicago has a population density of 11,783 people per square miles, ranking 9th highest in the country ([*source*](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities)). With reference to the broad landuse plan in Fig 2 above, the renowned Chicago CBD with predominantly commercial uses is located at the eastern edge of the city fronting Lake Michigan; residential areas are sprawled outwards in centrifugal fashion typical of US cities, and industrial areas are concentrated about major transport routes. In 2021, there were a total of 61 reported WNV cases and 3 associated deaths in Illinois, a size proportion of which was in Chicago ([*source*](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/preliminarymapsdata2021/disease-cases-state-2021.html)). Based on the [*2021 West Nile Virus Weekly Surveillance Reports*](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/infectious/west_nile_virus_surveillancereports.html), the WNV transmission rate peaks from early-August to mid-September, which coincides with the latter stages of Chicago's mosquito season. Thus far, the battle against WNV largely revolves around preventive measures at the individual scale ([*source*](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/infectious/preventing_west_nilevirus.html)), although seasonal targeted pesticide spraying has been inaugurated in recent years ([*source*](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/healthy_living/news/2021/august/city-to-spray-insecticide-wednesday-to-kill-mosquitoes.html)).

    "\n",
    "As members of the recently formed (fictitious) Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE) research team under the University of Chicago, the Chicago Municipal Government Department of Public Health has engaged us to develop a prediction model to identify the *spatial* and *temporal* elements of WNV. Specifically, the model should not only unearth areas in Chicago that are vulnerable to WNV but shed light on when cases are expected to escalate. The results will guide the state's effort in combating WNV through the deployment of pesticides. To this end, a cost-benefit analysis grounded in model predictions is to be conducted as part of business recommendations. Afterall, extensive pesticide use results in high monetary cost (i.e. taxpayer's income) and potential health hazards. "

    "The objective is to develop a classification model to predict the presence of WMV (using mosquitoes as proxies) in a particular location at a given time. To ensure production modelling is holistic, we not only consider a varied set of possible models as listed below, but create multiple pipelines and run accompanying gridsearches to optimize hyperparemeters: \n",

    "    e) Gradient Boost - Likewise, an ensemble technique which iteratively builds \"weak learners\" (albeit small trees as opposed to stumps) to create a final \"strong learner\". However, the difference lies in gradient boost attempts to fit subsequent learners to the residual errors made by the previous weaker learner. "

    "##### **Scoring Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure model performance evaluation is robust, we consider the scoring metrics below sequentially. For all metrics, we set a benchmark of 80% (i.e. >= 0.8) given that only a limited set of predictors (mainly climatic variables) are employed. \n",
    "\n",
    "    i) Accuracy [(TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)] - First, we review accuracy as the most fundamental indicator, which gives the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions. However, accuracy per se is inadequate as it does not inform on model effectiveness and precision, not to mention that it can be artificially tweaked by adjusting the threshold to achieve a biased outcome. Only models which meet the established benchment of 80% will be further evaluated. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii) ROC-AUC - Next, we examine the ROC-AUC score as the primary indicator of a model's performance. The ROC-AUC score informs on the extent to which the model minimizes false positives and false negatives effectivly, in which case a score of close to 1 is obtained. Conversely, for a weak model, the ROC-AUC score returns ~0.5, depicting the worst case scenario where the model has no discrimination capacity to distinguish between binary classes (i.e. whether a given location at a given time will have WNV or otherwise).  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    iii) Sensitivity [TP / (TP + FN)] - For this study, false negatives (i.e. model predicts absence of WNV when in reality, WNV is present) are relatively intolerable as it would result in excluding potentially high-risk areas for treatment on the basis that it was falsely identified as a no-/low-risk area for WNV. Hence, sensitivity will be considered too which seeks to minimize false negatives.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    iv) F1-score [2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)]; Precision = [TP / (TP + FP)]; Recall = [TP / (TP + FN)] - Defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, the former is a measure of accuracy of positive values predicted while the latter is a proxy of true positives successfully captured by the model. Putting both together, the F1-score provides a sense of confidence in a model's predicted positive values. Further, the F1-score is especially applicable for this study which involves imbalanced classes (dataset heavily skewed towards 0 rather than 1) as it takes data distribution into account. \n",
